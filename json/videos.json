    "description": "Where to Start with MBSE when Thousands of System Requirements Are Already Defined\n\nPresented by Peter Havenga and Laura Mallon (Thales Australia)\n\nSlides:  https://mbse-capella.org/resources/pdf/capelladays2021/CD21_THALES_AUS.pdf\n\nContext: The Thales OneSKY Australia Program is delivering a new Australia-wide integrated Civil and Military Air Traffic Management System, known as CMATS. CMATS replaces the current civilian Air Traffic Management (ATM) system and Defence ATM system, delivering the most advanced and integrated ATM system in the world. It will manage more than 11% of the earth’s airspace and will deliver Air Traffic Services to some of the world’s busiest air routes.\n\nScope: Over the last 4 years of the Design phases of the program, the System-of-Systems Architecture team has defined and deployed a new way of working by focussing on capturing the system-of-systems architecture using state-of-the-art modelling techniques.\nA plan was put in place where the team collectively defined a target set of modelling goals in order to grow the team’s competency. Part of this plan was a roadmap for the longer term which focused on extending the current approach to further increase the business value of the architecture modelling activities.\n\nThis approach has resulted in a stable working environment that not only allows the management of consistency and complexity, but also enables the team to collaboratively and efficiently work on the architecture definition, which has been critical during the recent working from home period and hectic project phases.\n\nThe key Capella solutions that are used within this activity are the Team for Capella solution, application of the Requirements Viewpoint and the Property Value Management Tool.\n\nOne of the important aspects of the modelling plan is to ensure information within the model can be used by the wider organisation, this is achieved through a Thales specific documentation generation solution and a bespoke csv export capability that allows to export data from the information captured in the architecture model.\n\nThis talk will cover the modelling goals for this activity; where the team is standing today; the best practices and lessons learned.\n\nCreative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

But what if it did not have to be this way?\n\nAt GU Orbit, we have adopted the Arcadia method exactly to make the process of engineering complex space systems more accessible to undergraduate students. With its multi-level workflow, repetitive activities, and opinionated semantics enforced by the Capella tool, it effectively guides even inexperienced users in the design of rational systems. Additionally, taking advantage of its semantic similarity to the European Space Agency's TASTE toolchain for embedded software development, we have devised an overarching methodology to rigorously bridge the gap between high-level system specifications and low-level component code.\n\nThis Arcadia-based method comprises the entire systems engineering lifecycle in a unified V-shaped model. The design phase is performed in Capella, regularly traversing all main functional decomposition levels. Specific physical-level views are then used to translate the resulting model into TASTE, trivialising the implementation phase down to individual lines of code in the Specification and Description Language (SDL, ITU-T Z.100) and C/C++. Finally, the verification and validation phases are carried out at all levels of abstraction by comparing specific TASTE-generated diagrams, such as State Chart Views and Message Sequence Charts (MSC, ITU-T Z.120), against their Capella-defined counterparts.\n\nIn this webinar, we will illustrate this method in the context of GU Orbit's student-led development of autonomous nanosatellite avionics, which were successfully demonstrated during an early stratospheric balloon flight.\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters: \n0:00 - Introduction and Contents\n1:20 - Presenting the Team and the Project\n9:49 - MBSE Adoption\n22:05 - Embedded Systems Development and \"Bridging the Gap\"\n56:50 - Q&A: What platforms used other than MSP-430?\n57:34 - Q&A: Are any of the models available?\n58:20 - Q&A: Did you try formal verification in TASTE?\n1:00:16 - Q&A: How to incorporate HW elements in TASTE?",

    "title": "Integration of Capella with Requirements Management Tools | Capella P4C Webinar | Obeo",
    "description": "Presented by Laurent Delaigue\n\n***\nWith the Arcadia method implemented by Capella, engineering is considered through three interrelated activities of equal importance:\n- Requirements engineering\n- Need analysis and modelling\n- Architecture building and validation\n\nThe first is generally conducted with a Requirements Management tool (such as Doors or Polarion), while the last two are conducted with Capella.\n\nUsing different tools raises questions about efficiently maintaining consistency and alignment between the architecture models and the requirements, and exposing a consistent integrated view of this interrelated data.\n\nDuring this webinar, you will see how the Publication for Capella add-on enables publishing Capella models on a web server and connecting them with requirements, change requests, test cases, releases, and more, defined in third-party repositories.\n\nThis solution breaks down silos between teams by providing online access to an integrated view of your system architecture. It facilitates your engineering teams' ability to reuse work items and system elements in a consistent and aligned process.\n\nWant to know more about P4C?

    "description": "Presented by Maxime Porhel\nHosted by Martin Lebourgeois\n***\n\nWorking with Capella models traditionally involves managing files, which requires careful coordination among team members to handle concurrent work. This often means having to establish strategies for reserving files or resolving conflicts after changes overlap.\n \nBy switching to multi-user mode in Capella, you can significantly enhance collaboration among your team of systems architects. This mode helps avoid the tedious management of file differences and reduces the risk of data loss.\n\nMulti-user mode allows team members to work simultaneously and safely on the same model by using:\n- A shared repository installed on a server to store the Capella model.\n- An add-on in your Capella workbench, activating a fine-grained locking mechanism that reserves model elements being edited.\n\nThese components work in sync to automatically release locks when modifications are saved and make them available to all connected users.\n\nDuring this webinar you will discover Team for Capella, an add-on that implements this approach to provide a seamless multi-user experience.\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters: \n0:00 - Introduction: What is Obeo?\n2:51 - Using Capella & The MBSE Approach\n9:12 - What is T4C?\n13:12 - Demo: Connect to a Projet & Live Collaboration\n16:55 - Shared Servers & Commits History\n18:25 - Demo: Description, Commit History & Export\n22:15 - T4C Workflows\n28:50 - T4C Deployments & First Use\n32:40 - Demo: Capella on Web Browser\n34:50 - Cloud for Capella (C4C)\n37:27 - Repositories Management\n40:04 - Conclusion on T4C\n41:18 - Publication for Capella : Going Further\n42:17 - Q&A: Capella model based on Eclipse CDO?\n43:05 - Q&A: Are the locks on diagrams shown to every users?\n44:00 - Q&A: When was T4C first released?\n***",

    "title": "A Model Based System Architecture Methodology Leveraging the ARCADIA Method | GWU | Capella Webinar",
    "description": "Presented by Dr. Eric Dano\nHosted by Laurent Delaigue\n\nSlides available here: https://bit.ly/capella_webinar_231005\n\n***\n\nSystem Architecture, its derived requirements and systems analysis performed, are often attributed to defining 70% of the cost and capabilities of a system. However, after nearly two decades of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), there is a lack of architecture focused methodologies and tools to aid programs in creating a robust, transdisciplinary system architecture. \n\nOne notable exception is the Thales developed Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) method and associated Capella modeling tool. The ARCADIA Architecture Development Method (ADM) provides instance-based methodologies for each ADM step with rich viewpoints and views to ensure a robust architecture is obtained. As the goal of the proposed methodology is to rapidly create a robust, transdisciplinary system architecture, ARCADIA was selected for its native alignment with this goal. \n\nHowever, the ARCADIA method is like a framework and requires a defined methodology to be applied to it to determine what views, and in what order, constitutes the desired architectural model. \n\nThe proposed methodology defined these elements based on alignment with the IEEE 15288:2015 architecture standard, and to further the goals of ease of learning, rapid modeling, and reduced modeler workload/errors.\n\nDr. Dano's Capella model : https://obeo-mirror-capella-releases.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/models/Missing_Person_Locator_Example.zip\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:25 - Speakers Introduction\n1:27 - Motivation behind the project\n3:40 - Outline\n3:56 - System Architecture Definition\n5:30 - Goal of the Proposed Methodology\n9:30 - Advantages of Capella\n12:35 - Proposed Methodology\n14:25 - Example: MPL System\n14:58 - Main presentation\n37:14 - Example: \"Ility\" Supplemental View\n39:43 - Conclusion\n42:46 - Q&A: State Machines\n44:40 - Q&A: How to customize Arcadia for small companies\n46:14 - Q&A: Using ARCADIA to adress DODAF Services viewpoints\n47:05 - Q&A: Did you connect requirements with architecture element\n48:30 - Q&A: How many levels of function in the model?\n49:49 - Q&A: Does Arcadia have a define ontology?\n50:38 - Q&A: Is there any challenged not addressed by the tool?\n52:11 - Q&A: Advantages of Capella/ARCADIA compared to OPM\n53:36- Q&A: Once the system architecture is iterated and developed using Arcadia capella, how does it get translated down the line ?\n56:22 - Q&A: Engraining testability at the start of modelling activities\n57:40 - Outro\n***",

Does your system require interaction with other systems to operate safely?\nDoes the design and operational concept of the system include contingency means? Do these contingency means correctly mitigate the risks?\n\nThese and other similar considerations are becoming more important with the emergence of autonomous systems and complex systems of systems. The introduction of digital tools and in particular model-based systems engineering allows to capture the complexity of these products starting from the operational analysis and supporting the process throughout the whole product life cycle.\n\nWith ATICA, system architects and designers will be able to analyze safety implications starting from the conceptual needs and mission description; modeling risks associated to the system, assessing the probability of occurrence and severity, and deciding upon the needs of contingency and mitigation means. ATICA enriches the Arcadia framework and provides safety analysis capabilities for each step of the system definition, design, and verification process.\n\nIn this webinar, we will address an example with an autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle, conceived for operation in urban environments (urban air mobility). We will present the operational description and system architecture, and we will conduct the Functional Hazard Analysis (FHA) directly from Capella and aligned with the normative standards in force in the aeronautic industry (ARP-4761 / ED-135).\n\nFinally, we will introduce safety analysis covering the logical and physical architecture levels, showcasing the use of Capella, Arcadia and ATICA for Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA).\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Speakers Introduction\n1:35 - Summary \n4:20 - Main presentation\n26:25 - Capella eVTOLDemo\n32:53 - Back to presentation\n40:30 - Q&A: STPA integration with ATICA\n41:10 - Q&A: Which function to use for FC identification?\n43:27 - Q&A: What process for System Analysis probabilistic requirements ?\n44:57 - Q&A: Does ATICA support FMEA?\n45:40- Q&A: Failure tolerance association to each FC\n46:53 - Q&A: Can you use other safety standards?\n47:32 - Q&A: What's the licensing model for the tool?\n48:14 - Q&A: Is there a license for academic use?\n48:34 - Q&A: ATICA supports OMG's RAAML?\n49:12 - Q&A: Does the tool support plausibility check?

    "title": "Making Arcadia work for you - a look at framework tailoring in Thales UK | Thales | Capella Webinar",
    "description": "Presented by Alex Laing and Andrew Pemberton from Thales UK\n\n*\n\nArchitecture frameworks provide an approach to describing systems and the presentation of these elements and relationships to deliver the stakeholder needs. Essentially, frameworks provide templates for our engineering artefacts.\n\nThe design of a framework must accommodate a level of freedom in its usage; specific enough to answer the majority of stakeholder concerns, whilst generic enough to allow for differences between projects. This balancing act often results in framework design being more generic to allow for a wider audience. Having an untailored framework, which is more ‘open’, can lead to creating inconsistent viewpoints.\n\nArcadia is one such framework as implemented through the Capella tool. The framework provides 4 perspectives/levels for product definition:\n- The Operational Analysis, where the user needs are considered. Note: no concept of the System at this level.\n- The System Analysis, where we define the contribution and scope of the System as a ‘black box’, identifying external interfaces, and top-level system functions.\n- The Logical Architecture, where we break the System down into logical ‘blocks’ and decompose the functionality.\n- The Physical Architecture, in which we define a (candidate) physical architecture, further decompose the functions, and deploy this functionality to the physical sub-systems, hardware, software and/or firmware.\n\nIn this talk, we acknowledge the strengths of the Arcadia framework, and the benefits it brings, whilst considering the need to tailor the generic viewpoints. We will provide examples of how we have adopted the generic Arcadia framework and further specified some of the viewpoints to meet the needs of our stakeholders. We will discuss future work looking at how we can translate these specialisations across other areas of the model. Finally, we will provide some suggestions and advice on tailoring views to meet your own needs and ensuring stakeholder engagement with the model.\n\n*\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia\n\n*\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:19 - Main presentation\n48:14 - Q&A: How do you work out requirements management and traceability?\n49:24 - Q&A: Have you ever managed V&V needs in the definition of tailoring?\n50:45 - Q&A: How is your experience to use Capella in bottom up design?\n54:43 - Q&A: What were the main barriers of embedding Capella into the Thales organisation ?\n57:55 - Q&A: How do you maintain the \"big picture\" view?\n1:00:07 - Q&A: How have you captured and enforced modelling rules/conventions amongst members of the modelling team ?\n1:00:10 - Q&A: What's your balance of trained Capella Modellers vs non-systems engineers?\n1:03:23 - Q&A: In terms of Framework tailoring, are you actually changing anything in the framework data model?\n1:04:42 - Q&A: Can you explain how you generated documentation to views?\n1:06:52 - Q&A: How does Thales capture design rationale in Capella?\n1:08:33 - Q&A: The Functional Chains: are these of the individual Functions?\n1:11:19 - Q&A: Did you developed a color taxonomy code?\n1:11:58 - Q&A: Haven't you used Operational Analysis to capture Stakeholder needs?\n1:15:28 - Q&A: Unanswered questions\n\n*",

    "description": "Presented by: Michael Schäfer\n***\nAls vor einigen Jahren in Nordeuropa ein großes Projekt im Bereich der Leit- und Sicherungstechnik für Eisenbahnen ausgeschrieben war, hat Thales sich an diesem Projekt beteiligt und dort zum ersten Mal in einer Angebotsphase ARCADIA als Methodik und Capella® als Tool für Model-Based-System-Engineering eingesetzt. Auf den Capella Days 2018 wurden von uns die Ergebnisse dieses Einsatzes vorgestellt. In der Zwischenzeit hat sich nun dieses Angebotsprojekt in ein reales Projekt verwandelt.\n\nDamit stellte sich für uns bei Thales die Frage, wie arbeiten wir in ARCADIA und Capella® weiter. Der Vortrag zeigt daher den \"langen Weg\" vom Angebotsmodell zum einem Projektmodell in Capella®. Neben Fragen wie \"Was kann aus dem Angebotsmodell wiederverwendet werden?\" oder \"Wie können wir die Anzahl der Systemarchitekten, die an dem Projekt arbeiten, schnell erhöhen?\", werden auch einige der Fallstricke auf diesem Weg präsentiert.\n\nZusätzlich gibt dieser Vortrag Antworten auf Fragen wie \"Welche der verschiedenen Sichten von ARCADIA sind für welchen Zweck geeignet?\" oder \"Wie kann man spezielle Themen wie die Kommunikation mit Kunden, die Beschreibung externer Schnittstellen oder Sicherheitsaspekte für ein großes Eisenbahnverkehrsmanagementsystem modellieren?\".\n\nSeminar Kernaussagen\nFolgende Kernaussagen ergeben sich aus den Erfahrungen des Einsatzes von ARCADIA und Capella® auch in frühen Phasen eines Projekts:\n\n- Die Methodik und das Tool lassen sich gewinnbringend auch in einer Angebotsphase einsetzen, wenn man sich auf die notwendigen Teile beschränkt, damit das Angebotsteam eine einheitliche Sicht auf den Entwurf erhält.\n- Dieses Angebotsmodell lässt sich im Umsetzungsprojekt weiterverwenden, wobei der Fokus auf den funktionalen Aspekten und deren Beschreibung liegt.\n- Als hilfreich hat sich eine Fokussierung auf kritische Bereiche herausgestellt, z.B. auf Funktionen, die eine Sicherheitsrelevanz tragen.\n- Als Herausforderung stellt sich auch hier der notwendige kulturelle Wandel von einem textuellen, dokumentenzentrierten Vorgehen zu einem modellbasierten Vorgehen.\n***\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-m...\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

    "description": "Presented by Kai Liu from Glaway\n\n*\n\n\"Through a large number of engineering practices in China, we found that customers not only pay attention to how the object product can be modeled more quickly and reasonably, but also pay attention to the correctness of the model itself. Therefore, the simulability and analyzability of the model are very important.\n\nUsers expect Capella to provide value in logic simulation and parametric analysis. According to the needs of customers, improvements have been made in the following aspects:\n\n1. We decided to add the concept and related elements of activity diagrams in Sysml to Capella to make the function flow executable;\n2. Referring to the state machine specification in Sysml, we assign dynamic execution rules to the elements in the Capella state machine so that they can be simulated and operated;\n3. Support nested calls and interrupt logic between state machines and activity diagrams to enrich the simulation scenarios.\n4. Support integration and calling with Matlab to make algorithm verification simpler and more feasible.\n5. Developed a running interface for simulation, so that engineers can get more information through simulation (for example: simulation animation effect; simulation speed adjustable;\nSimulation can be paused; simulation data can be modified in real-time and feedback can be obtained; simulation data can be recorded and related curves generated)\"\n\n*\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia\n\n*",

This is the reason why the Systems Engineering community defined standardized practices (such as the ones defined in ISO15288:2015), to realize successful systems, several years ago.\n\nHowever, performing these practices with the traditional \"\"document based\"\" approach may be limited due to the difficulty of checking the overall consistency of the engineering documents. Using MBSE methods and tools (such as proposed by the ARCADIA method and Capella tool) is a great help to support the stakeholder requirements analysis and system requirements / architecture definition. However, it is sometimes difficult to \"\"map/instantiate\"\" the standard processes (ISO15288:2015) to implementation using ARCADIA method and Capella, especially when adapted to the specific practices of each company. \n\nDuring this talk, you will gain insights concerning the relations between the ISO15288:2015 processes and the ARCADIA approach, illustrated using the Health Agriculture UAV case study and focus on some common topics such as implementation of MOEs/MOPs in the model. \"\n\n*\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia\n\n*",

However, truth is not exclusively found within models. The need to describe external contracts, regulations, or non-functional requirements, for instance, can be more efficiently satisfied by using textual specifications. In order to achieve the desired “Common Source of Truth”, model and textual requirements must be connected and coexist, desirable enhanced by the automatization of the consistency checking, automatically modifying one side when changes are produced on the other end...\n\nWithin The REUSE Company, we have realised how crucial it is to facilitate this connection and provide Systems Engineers with the tools required for applying SE across the entire process as seamlessly as possible. This solution is the SES ENGINEERING Studio, and within this webinar, the following capabilities will be shown:\n\n- The SES ENGINEERING Studio offers the capability to assess consistency between textual requirements and Capella models.\n- Automatic generation of Capella models from Textual Requirements inside an RMS (Requirements Management System). This also involves the possibility to complete the exact opposite operation, generating textual requirements from Capella models.\n- Seamless traceability management between textual requirements (in any RMS) and model elements in Capella; This includes the possibility to automatically suggest traces based on the semantic content of the textual requirement.\n- If the preferred option is to maintain these textual requirements inside Capella, we offer the possibility to provide a round-trip process between any RMS and Requirements Viewpoint within Capella; thus, allowing that modification at either end, to be synchronized.\n- Automatic quality assessment of Capella models following a number of pre-established rules or allowing the users to define tailored rules.\n- Automatic interoperability between SysML and Arcadia models.\n\n***\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia\n\n***",

There is a need to foster greater collaboration between these disciplines to avoid errors and also to maintain time-to-market.\n\nThat's why since several years, ALL4TEC, with its safety analysis tool Safety Architect, has been working to connect its tool with system solutions to couple MBSE and MBSA. The goal is to better ensure consistency between system design and safety analysis.\n\nDuring this talk, ALL4TEC presents its Capella add-on that allows annotation of Capella models with basic safety information, smart export and dynamic connection to share data between Capella and Safety Architect to support MBSE-MBSA.\n\n***\nFollow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:\n\nBlog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia\n\n***",

    "description": "Presented by Catherine Morlet and Alberto González from the European Space Agency.\nThe slides of the presentation are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_ESA_slides\n\n***\nThis presentation reports on the collaborative Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach followed for Galileo Second Generation using Team4Capella. We address the choices made and methodology applied in Phase B of the system design activity in the past years, with a team spread in different companies’ and geographically distributed. We address the handling of branches of model at different security classification levels with an approach based on synchronising branches rather than split of a large model that makes it suitable for parallel development thus compatible with schedule/time-keeping constraint of the project. Overall, there is a need of rigorous methodology to facilitate synchronisation activities, to have common development approaches including terminology/nomenclature to identify relevant classified items (functions, exchange item, scenarios, etc.), and to document/textualized the information allowing for automatic and frequent generation of the design documentation. \nIn large projects, team members are involved in different roles, thus implying “rules” as well on who is acting on a part of a model. But also, some may be focused on review/supervision of the model which implies the need for means for commenting models rather than developing. Instead of exporting (e.g. in word documents) we expect that tools such as “Publication for Capella” would help enlarging the users of MBSE within the team.\nAnother area under investigation is the collaboration across teams to ensure digital continuity throughout the disciplines or sub-systems. We are starting to use the system-to-subsystem transition plugin with the aim to maintain interfaces between sub-systems and specification of each subsystem, and apportion some engineering parameters between subsystems thanks to a model. Direct interaction at model level is expected, and, through synchronisation mechanisms, integrate at the system level the outcomes from the subsystems in a form of a federated model.\n\n***\nReferences: \nEmbarking to end-to-end system modelling for Galileo Second Generation\npresented at MBSE2022 in Toulouse\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro and Outline\n1:30 - Galileo and its complexity\n6:09 - Collaborative end-to-end system design including security levels\n17:03 - Collaboration among stakeholders \n27:39 - Concluding remarks\n34:23 - Q&A: Can Capella be used to asses change options for complex system?\n35:15 - Q&A: Do you use other tools along with Capella to manage requirements?\n36:40 - Q&A: How did you managed all the interfaces?\n38:00 - Q&A: Have you worked with external team using SysXML?\n39:53 - Q&A: Questions concerning the internal and external teams.\n44:41 - Q&A: Why you choose to use Capella?\n46:40 - Outro",

In particular, the paradigms of centralized source of information, enhanced traceability or automated analysis speed-up significantly the design and verification tasks and reduce the sources of errors; which results in an overall gain of quality in the engineering processes.\n\nIn this talk we will showcase the implementation of a model-driven approach to the design and development of an electromechanical actuator conceived to control the aerodynamic surfaces of a conventional aircraft. Our industrial partner is involved in a transformation process towards the digitalization of their engineering activities and is interested in particular in using MBSE as a way to foster collaboration between teams and ensure consistency across different engineering tasks.\n\nOur work started with an analysis of different MBSE tools, evaluating the suitability of such tools to meet a set of criteria considered relevant to support efficiently the process, not only at systems engineering level, but also coupling with other engineering disciplines that will interact with the model. For different reasons that will be detailed in the webinar Capella was selected as the reference platform for this activity.\n\nUsing Capella, the stakeholder needs for the electromechanical actuator have been analyzed and developed across the system, logical and physical architectures. In the talk, the main features of the system will be described, emphasizing the specificities of the model that allow the coordination and sharing of information between teams (mainly electronics, simulation and RAMS).\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Summary & introduction to the company\n1:42 - Project Scope\n3:50 - Electromechanical Actuation System\n11:30 - MBSE tools trade-off\n14:00 - Digital Engineering Framework\n18:12 - Requirements Management with IBM DOORS\n20:40 - System Model\n27:35 - ATICA4Capella - Safety Metamodel\n29:03 - ATICA4Capella - MBSA & FHA\n30:31 - ATICA4Capella - Requirements Viewpoint\n31:21 - ATICA4Capella - MBSA Logical level\n32:07 - Failure net/FMES Generation\n33:33 - Connection with Simulink\n34:34 - Conclusions\n37:20 - Next Steps\n38:13 - Q&A: How does Capella differ from Reliability Workbech by Isograph?\n40:01 - Q&A: How much time did it take to develop the model?\n42:07 - Q&A: How do you connect Capella to Simulink?\n42:59 - Q&A: Does ATICA support user-defined enumerations for risk assessment?\n43:50 - Q&A: Question about the model development for EMA.\n48:30 - Outro",

    "description": "Capella for Modelling CubeSat: Tailored SE Process for Leveraging Model-Based Systems Engineering\nPresented by Suvigya Gupta, Dhirendra Singh and Stueti Gupta from BlueKei Solutions.\nThe slides presentations are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_BlueKei_slides\n\n***\nCubeSat developers face a unique set of challenges when designing and deploying small satellite systems. They are continually striving to enhance reliability and efficiency of these small satellite systems. Evolving mission requirements arise a need to provide for objective evidence of mission assurance. Systems Engineering approach backed up by MBSE practices can enable minimizing project disruptions by optimizing and ensure that CubeSats can adapt to evolving mission requirements. This could facilitate efficient resource allocation, minimize design errors, and enhance overall mission success. CubeSat developers can optimize operational and system analysis, construct a comprehensive End Product Breakdown Structure, tailor SE efforts to the development lifecycle, and effectively tackle common development challenges, such as compatibility issues during integration and testing. \n\nThe goal of this presentation is to enable CubeSat developers seamlessly integrate SE practices along with MBSE into their existing workflows.\n\nKeeping our assumptions close to industry practice, a model has been developed relying on available literature on CubeSat development using Capella. Using the model as reference, this presentation will be highlighting on proposed tailored SE process that is intended to provide a strategic advantage by enabling more predictable project outcomes. The model will be focused on supporting systematic decomposition of CubeSat functions and architectures to gain a clearer understanding of system's operational logic and physical components. It would also address effective interface management and agile development using functional chain that could further contribute to increased redundancy for CubeSat.\n\nIn conclusion, by embracing SE & MBSE practices, it is intended to promote the development of CubeSats that remain reliable throughout their operational lifetimes, furthering advancements in space exploration, scientific research, and technology demonstration.\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Speakers introduction\n3:15 - Outline\n4:15 - CubeSats in a nutshell\n7:22 - Where lies the complexity?\n13:25 - How does SE and MBSE help manage complexity?\n14:39 - Vee Model\n17:18 - Digital Thread - Traceability\n18:42 - Scope of Modeling\n19:27 - How does system model contribute to dealing with the technical-management challenges?\n20:15 - Operational Analysis\n22:05 - System analysis\n25:00 - Architecture\n29:16 - System Model - Observations\n33:30 - Conclusion\n35:25 - Q&A: Can we use Capella or Matlab for appropriate physical outcome?\n36:47 - Q&A: What is the length of the Full System Model?\n37:50 - Q&A: How are Non-Functional Requirements handled in Capella?\n39:38 - Q&A: Can we generate electrical ICD from physical model?\n41:20 - Q&A: Question from the chairman regarding alternative trade-offs\n43:35 - Outro",

    "description": "Enterprise Modelling for Lifecycle Engineering on the Example of Sustainability.\nPresented by Chantal Sinnwell and Michael Bitzer from Siemens Digital Industries Software\nThe slides presentations are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_Siemens-DIS_slides\n\n***\nSystems Engineering is a methodology to design complex systems in interdisciplinary teams from concept to production to operation. It considers the complete problem with its business and technical needs: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training, support, test, manufacturing, and many more. Companies that strive to become Digital Enterprises can leverage Systems Engineering as an approach to consider a company as a System-of-Systems with its individual lifecycles and ecosystems along their Digital Transformation.\nWhen applying model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to model required Digital Enterprise capabilities, this approach also supports companies in understanding the impact of topics like e.g. Sustainability. Sustainability impacts a company’s product portfolio, manufacturing systems, service delivery as well as most other business processes. Though, sustainability-oriented approaches like Lifecycle Engineering are necessary, to consider the comprehensive technical, environmental, and economic impacts of decisions within the Enterprise System Lifecycle.\nThis talk will explain – based on a comprehensive example on digital farming solutions – how System Engineering can be applied to understand causalities in Enterprise Systems and to come to meaningful strategic business decisions. It will illustrate how Capella Models can be used for MBSE of agricultural Enterprise Systems with their Products (e.g. grain, meat, milk), Manufacturing Systems (fields, agricultural machinery, stables), Business Processes (e.g. sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, milking) and Ecosystems (e.g. agricultural machinery manufacturers, contract workers, satellite data providers). This talk will also demonstrate, how such Capella Models can consequentially be leveraged to apply the method of Lifecycle Engineering to understand the impact of lifecycle-spanning topics like Sustainability on the Architecture of Enterprises, its Products, Manufacturing systems and Business Processes.\n\n***\nReferences:\n-C.

This approach is generic and is used into several projects for Energy and Railway industries.\nThe objective of this approach is to enhance the efficiency (value driven) of the System Architecting and Engineering activities on a project. \nThe principle of the tailoring approach is to focus from “generic” (coming from SE standards or general-purpose ARCADIA description or general-purpose usage of CAPELLA tool) down to a “specific” (applicable by the project team for the objectives and the context of a real project).\nThis approach is based on a framework (to define generic standards, processes and method). Then, several steps of the approach allow to tailor generic processes and the ARCADIA method. Then, the tailored SE processes and the tailored ARCADIA method are formalized into documents to allow their concrete application on a real project by the project team.\nThe tailoring framework defined by CAPGEMINI is composed of 1) a BPMN model of SE processes, activities and tasks from ISO15288 / INCOSE Handbook, 2) a generic datamodel of SE concepts used by processes, 3) an ARCADIA cartography of levels, objects and views.\nThe steps of the approach allow to define SE/MBSE added values expected by the project. Then a ranking of complexity of the System of Interest will support the tailoring of SE processes and ARCADIA method.\nTo support the concrete application of the project, the output of the tailoring approach is a SEMP document (System Engineering Management Plan) for the project and a MBSE method based on ARCADIA. Trainings sessions on the MSBE tailored method and on the CAPELLA tool allow a right deployment on the project.\nMBSE models are means and not objectives.\n\n***\nReferences:\nhttps://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Application_of_Systems_Engineering_Standards\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro and summary\n1:33 - Capgemini Engineering and its team\n6:50 - Clients\n7:36 - Tailoring?

    "description": "Efficient and Comprehensive FMECAs: Harnessing the Power of MBSE Models in Capella.\n\nPresented by Sushim Koshti and Neela Ayalasomayajula from Applied Materials\nThe slides of the presentation are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_Applied-Materials_slides\n\n***\nModel-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has redefined the paradigms of systems engineering, and Capella stands out as a quintessential MBSE tool. One of the emergent challenges in this space is the seamless translation of information from MBSE models into other actionable formats, such as FMECAs (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis). Historically, the FMECA generation process has been reliant on cross-functional engineering teams collaborating in brainstorming sessions to identify potential failure modes before they can even start analysis the effects and criticality of these failure modes. While effective, this approach is time-consuming and can often overlook critical failure modes due to inherent limitations of manual brainstorming.  \n\nUsing a case study from the semiconductor equipment industry, our presentation describes a method of leveraging Capella MBSE models to streamline the generation of FMECAs. Utilizing Python4Capella, we automated the extraction of vital MBSE model objects and relationships, essential for generating an exhaustive FMECA, and seamlessly populated it into an MS Excel based FMECA template that is commonly used by the engineering community.\n \nThis presentation will offer participants: \n-The significance and role of MBSE models in building a robust FMECA. \n-An overview of our Python4Capella based solution, shedding light on how we captured and translated the Capella objects to a FMECA Excel template.\n-Demonstrable advantages, insights, and takeaways from our semiconductor equipment industry case study, underscoring the transformative power of MBSE and automation in accuracy, efficiency, and traceability.\n \nEquipped with a practical exploration of our methodology, attendees will be equipped with a potent strategy, not only to reimagine FMECA generation in their domains but also to maximize the potential of their MBSE models, making design reliability and safety assessments more rigorous and efficient.\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro and agenda\n1:26 - Presentation of the company\n2:50 - Product Development & MBSE\n5:35 - Electrostatic chucks\n7:30 - MBSE driven design for e-chucks\n18:25 - FMECA : Failures Modes, Effects, Criticality analysis\n20:55 - Typical Design FMECA Process\n23:55 - Shortcomings of Current Process\n27:34 - Leveraging MBSE Models for FMECAs\n32:53 - Building FMECA matrix from MBSE model\n35:22 - Advantages and next steps\n39:47 - Q&A: Will you share the Python scripts developed for export to FMECA?\n40:05 - Q&A: Any internal figures regarding productivity/quality improvements?\n41:47 - Q&A: How to ensure the physical components in Capella are up to date with the ones on your CAD system?\n43:40 - Q&A: Evaluating the effects on your system of every failure of the FMECA?\n44:58 - Outro",

This presentation focuses on applying some of these Lean Startup techniques within Capella to effectively arrive at system architectures.\n\nIn contrast to other MBSE programs, Capella embeds a design methodology that drives its usage; it provides a framework for defining the problem before progressing to solutions. This presentation will guide the strategic application of Lean Startup techniques within the different architectural levels prescribed by ARCADIA. To ensure problem-solution fit for each stakeholder, unique Value Proposition Canvases (VPCs) connect their needs and wants with how the system will work for them. In the Operational Analysis phase, problem interviews will help determine the Customer Profile portion of the VPCs. Functions in the System Analysis represent the gain achievers and pain relievers proposed in the VPCs Value Map section. These are then validated with solution interviews before starting the logical or physical architecture. During both stages of the architectural design, functional chains are used to determine which parts of the design need to be validated. Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), based on these functional chains, can be built to collect validated learnings about customers and other stakeholders. MVPs are not saleable products themselves, but the learnings from these MVPs are integrated in the architecture to ensure that the final product creates value.\n\n***\nReferences:\nTheLeanStartup.com\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Traditional approach\n5:22 - Lean Startup Approach\n9:45 - Understanding the Needs with Capella\n13:00 - Understanding the Needs: Operational Analysis\n22:16 - Understanding the Needs: System Analysis\n30:45 - The Architecture\n37:14 - Conclusion\n38:32 - Q&A: How to handle expectations if you only earn gains and pains?\n39:15 - Q&A: How would you rate the role of the costs?\n40:48 - Q&A: Are your customers always willing to share their pains?\n42:10 - Q&A: How do you tune the detail level of your Capella model for FEMECA?\n43:18 - Outro",

These notions offer potential for a more detailed understanding of failure effects, aiding safety analysts in priority scoring. \n\nThis presentation will describe how we relate three different failure classes to failure effects by relying particularly on the information in Exchange Scenario diagrams and illustrate an example of implementing such an method using a common system model in Capella. \n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro and outline\n2:52 - Poll 1: In which industry do you work?\n4:04 - Safety Assessment Methods\n5:13 - Poll 2: Which of these do you use or see in your industry?\n6:09 - What about completeness\n7:03 - Known tools for Capella\n8:40 - Poll 3: Which of these do you use?\n9:35 - Project scope\n12:23 - Poll 4: Do you think it is possible/appropriate to use this strategy to achieve a high degree of completeness in failure identification?

Reference architectures including a clear functional breakdown can support them and support their decisions. This presentation proposes an approach to improve the development of advanced electron microscopes by using Capella as an authoritative source of information. To support design decisions, a Capella AddOn has been developed to obtain quantitative information, such as throughput numbers, for a particular workflow. First, we will illustrate how functional and system decompositions can be captured and serve as company-wide architecting assets to inform design decisions. Next, we will outline how simulating Capella models can bring valuable insights to modelers. During a demo, we’ll simulate Capella’s Functional chains using the open-source simulation tool POOSL (https://github.com/eclipse/poosl) , and visualize results using the freely available TRACE4CPS tool (https://www.eclipse.org/trace4cps/). Re-using functions from the reference architecture allows us to reason about design aspects such as the relation between throughput and design choices about function allocation and parallelism.\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

You identify that your manufacturing planning team and your product design team don’t collaborate with each other, because they work in silos and speak different languages. Their progress is too slow, and the results are not synchronized.\n\nImagine: You succeed in merging your experts into one interdisciplinary team where everyone is collaboratively working together – already in the early stages of the engineering cycle. And imagine they start to speak the same language. Doubtless, you would speed up your engineering process. Furthermore, you would also reach a synchronized global solution for your manufacturing system and to be produced toy cars, building bridges inside your organization.\n\nBut how? This has been introduced by Dr.-Ing. C. Sinnwell in February 2020 in her PhD-thesis. There, she published the latest version of a methodology referred to as “MBPE – Model-Based Production Engineering”. The MBPE-methodology is a new approach for the conceptual design of manufacturing systems based on early product information supported by MBSE using UML.\n\nThe presentation will spotlight the MBPE-methodology, explaining how to use MBSE in the context of interdisciplinary factory and manufacturing planning. Also, it will be shown, how the methodology could be adapted to be realized with Eclipse Capella instead of any UML-modeling tool, illustrated by an example on how to conceptualize and model a LEGO Mindstorms production line for Toy Cars.\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

We dream or in the best cases take advantage of digital continuity, automation, large-scale consistency, integration of disciplines, and end-to-end impact analyses.\n\nHowever not all of our architect and engineer fellows are in a situation in which they can appreciate sophistication of engineering practices the same way as we do. Entangled in everyday problems and facing the pressure to deliver, they perceive the introduction of model-based practices as an additional risk for a benefit that too often appears intangible.\n\nReaching the top of the stairs requires climbing the very first steps. This talk focuses on one of the most challenging aspects of MBSE deployment: lowering the height of the first steps.

This presentation instead aims at exploring the educational benefits of applying the opposite practice, thus retrieving system and subsystem level requirements based on a solution already implemented and taking advantage of the MBSE possibilities to realize a model of the system according to the ARCADIA method and systems engineering approach, using the Capella MBSE Tool. This reverse-engineering process has been applied to a renowned Space mission, the ESA Mars Express satellite, whose goal is to investigate all aspects of the martian environment, including the subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet, in order to search for evidence of extinct or extant life. The uppermost goal of this project is to demonstrate the benefits for university students at a Master's level keen on systems engineering in implementing the Capella tool to retrieve the system architecture and the operational processes in a \"reversed\" strategy. In this work, students have been compelled to apply systems engineering processes to justify the design choices and exploit the already well-known missions and capabilities to build the architecture and functional chains as a starting point for the reverse engineering of the identified subsystems. The results prove it is possible, and also recommendable time-wise, to teach Space engineering and Systems engineering students by using this inverse approach, rather than the canonic one in which students have to design a whole mission from scratch.\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

The handbook introduces 3 common technical processes. One of these, is the System Design Process, describing the stakeholder's expectations, requirements definition, logical decomposition, and design solution definition. The 4 activities can be supported by a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. To do so, an appropriate method and tool is necessary as the one provided by the ARChitecture Analysis & Design Integrated Approach.\n\nARCADIA, with its modeler CAPELLA, is an MBSE solution supporting system modeling activities. Based on 4 architectural layers, which are Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical and Physical Architecture, it is a structured architecture engineering method for defining and validating multi-domain systems.\nThis talk will present an educational overview of the ARCADIA methodology and System Design Process from the NASA SE, by introducing MBSE artifacts for space system.\n\nThe HUBBLE Space Telescope (HST) is a Cassegrain reflector telescope. Orbiting above the earth, HST elaborates a clear view of the universe free from the blurring and absorbing effects of the atmosphere. In order to illustrate the journey throughout CAPELLA, the HST will be introduced, as example, based on public information available.",

UKAEA, the organisation running the STEP project, is applying Model-Based Systems Engineering using the Capella tool.\n\nThe focus of our approach in managing the complexity of the system is to perform system analysis and logical architecture analysis, to generate engineering artefacts from the model. Through NGO (Needs, Goals, Objectives) analysis key system capabilities were realised to functional chains, which forms the basis for further refinement of the Logical Architecture. The differentiation between logical and physical architectures has ensured that the design stays at the logical space and the team focuses on defining the problem space. This approach has improved interface management process, by creating model-based interface documents, using the model as ‘single source of truth’ to achieve consistency. The architecture definition activities allowed early formalisation of the textual requirements, to drive detailed engineering design in the next phase.\n\nAdopting Capella comes with challenges - one of which stems from the unique characteristic of the concept phase – the need to generate architectural variants and evaluating them. The framework and the language are limited in performing variant modelling, a topic UKAEA plans to investigate further. Another challenge was that middle-out approach was favoured for STEP whereas Arcadia method prefers the top-down approach.\n\nThroughout this journey, adopting Capella with its use-friendly interfaces has allowed us to better engage with the programme in the MBSE approach and indoctrinate better SE practices.\n\nCreative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

At the very least, systems engineering organizes and integrates the work of the various engineering disciplines and groups. Slightly more ambitiously, MBSE can translate system requirements into system elements. Ideally though, the system model, as the output of the MBSE process, should directly participate in the digital thread, as the link between the system requirements and the bill-of-material.\n\nThis presentation will show how the more idealised role (as a participant in the digital thread) can now be realized and explore some of the benefits and costs associated to such an approach.",

    "description": "Where to Start with MBSE when Thousands of System Requirements Are Already Defined\n\nPresented by Peter Havenga and Laura Mallon (Thales Australia)\n\nSlides:  https://bit.ly/capelladays2021_thales_australia_slides\n\nContext: The Thales OneSKY Australia Program is delivering a new Australia-wide integrated Civil and Military Air Traffic Management System, known as CMATS. CMATS replaces the current civilian Air Traffic Management (ATM) system and Defence ATM system, delivering the most advanced and integrated ATM system in the world. It will manage more than 11% of the earth’s airspace and will deliver Air Traffic Services to some of the world’s busiest air routes.\n\nScope: Over the last 4 years of the Design phases of the program, the System-of-Systems Architecture team has defined and deployed a new way of working by focussing on capturing the system-of-systems architecture using state-of-the-art modelling techniques.\nA plan was put in place where the team collectively defined a target set of modelling goals in order to grow the team’s competency. Part of this plan was a roadmap for the longer term which focused on extending the current approach to further increase the business value of the architecture modelling activities.\n\nThis approach has resulted in a stable working environment that not only allows the management of consistency and complexity, but also enables the team to collaboratively and efficiently work on the architecture definition, which has been critical during the recent working from home period and hectic project phases.\n\nThe key Capella solutions that are used within this activity are the Team for Capella solution, application of the Requirements Viewpoint and the Property Value Management Tool.\n\nOne of the important aspects of the modelling plan is to ensure information within the model can be used by the wider organisation, this is achieved through a Thales specific documentation generation solution and a bespoke csv export capability that allows to export data from the information captured in the architecture model.\n\nThis talk will cover the modelling goals for this activity; where the team is standing today; the best practices and lessons learned.\n\nCreative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

    "description": "Enhancing CubeSat design through ARCADIA and Capella: a concrete application\n\nPresented by: Paolo Minacapilli (Politecnico di Milano)\n\nSlides: https://bit.ly/capelladays2021_Politecnico_Milano_slides\n\nThe new space economy asks for an overall improvement of systems engineering practices due to aggressive development time and complex systems design, implementation and operation by a number of players who grow with mission complexity. The talk proposes a critical analysis of a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach using ARCADIA and the Capella tool, applied to real CubeSat mission, with the aim of showing potentials and lacks.\n\nFirstly, the way requirements are managed and traced using the Requirements Viewpoint is presented, highlighting the necessity of having a dedicated diagram for the trees generation; a solution to that is proposed in order to easily trace backwards requirements whenever needed. Following the ARCADIA method, the approach begins with the high-level objectives definition through the Operational Analysis, moving to a first internal functional analysis exploiting the second level of Capella, the System Analysis. The Logical Architecture is then developed introducing the concept of subsystem, leading to big decisions which will drive the successive Physical Architecture. The latter opens the road to all CubeSat components modeling using the concept of Node Physical Component, together with physical interfaces definition. Great use of all Capella concepts is done, such as Functional Chains, Control Functions, Replicas, Basic Mass and Price Viewpoints etc.\n\nAs the approach has been applied to a real space project, Phases and Modes have also been modeled exploiting respectively Scenario Diagrams, also used to define mission Concept of Operations, and State Machine Diagrams. Some thoughts oriented toward an improvement of the Modes management will be discussed. Lastly, ARCADIA and Capella do not provide a proper way of dealing with Assembly, Integration, Verification and Testing activities within the same architectural model, therefore an innovative approach is proposed and discussed to include such aspects in the model.",

    "title": "An ex. of model-centric engineering environment with Capella and CI/CD | DB Netz | Capella Days 2021",
    "description": "An example of model-centric engineering environment with Capella and CI/CD\n\nPresented by: Viktor Kravchenko (DB Netz AG)\n\nSlides: https://bit.ly/capelladays2021_DBNetzAG_slides\n\nToday a number of EU railway operators are on a journey to define what the future of railway operations should look like. In Germany, DB AG works within the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland. Next to the implementation of ETCS/DSTW technology in the first stage, the initiatives aims in the second stage to improve the performance, quality and efficiency of the railway system by higher degrees of automation in traffic management, train driving and infrastructure operation. This requires implementation of new technologies like artificial intelligence, localization and perception sensors, cloud computing and 5G connectivity.\n\nThe challenge is pretty serious - to modernize and digitalize something as complex we need a solid understanding of the railway system itself, the surrounding actors, the operational processes / workflows, functions and responsibilities. And then we need a way to design automation concepts and test those against the operational needs - we call it The Reference Architecture. An analysis of that scale requires knowledge and expertise across multiple domains and involves a pretty large number of stakeholders. We found ARCADIA method to be just the right thing and as Capella is freely available we could easily test how it fits.\n\nThe reference architecture is being developed in according to a detailed process that elaborates on the basic steps of ARCADIA to give specific guidelines on every step of engineering. The process is broadly structured in the layers of ARCADIA, then influenced by the safety and RAM standard EN 50126, the systems engineering standard ISO 15288 and the specific situation we found ourselves in. The process is described according to architecture framework standard ISO 42010 with an emphasis on precise definition of the contents of each modelling artefact. Early results of the deployment of this detailed process have been positive, with reductions in the complexity of the model, and clearer, more precise and more consistent functions being identified against a reusable pattern.\n\nTo validate the design decisions and assumptions that we made in the Reference Architecture, when a simulation is insufficient, we do prototype projects. The Sensors4Rail prototype project was designed in Capella nearly from the start. And for a number of common engineering reasons it was designed bottom up. It is an example of a classical project madness with disruptive changes, priority shifts and very high level of uncertainty. And thanks to flexibility of Capella and ARCADIA we got through it with the model being the place where most of the engineering decisions took place - be it functional, software or hardware engineering.\n\nAs the adoption went on we saw a need for deriving documents and engineering artifacts from the model and sharing those with various internal and external stakeholders. We tried to do that by hand first but as it was time consuming we went through a project to automate workflows around Capella. Today we operate a number of CI/CD pipelines that deliver documents, engineering artifact and Confluence page updates on every commit. We have a framework that enables us to derive engineering artifacts from the model quickly, traverse it in all possible directions and render in any shape and form (IDL, pdf, xlsx). For those projects that use TeamForCapella we operate a self-service web-based management environment.\n\nIn this presentation you’ll have a guided tour through the MBSE Toolchain we made around Capella, Gitlab, Confluence, Jira and TeamForCapella and get a feeling for what automation one could get by mixing open-source with nice (open API) commercial and simple bespoke tools.\n\nCreative commons BY-ND Licence: Attributon + NoDerivatives",

Applying MBSE can be one way of achieving this. Here we present the results of an inexperienced modeler taking existing code logic and modeling it in Capella 5.0, and measuring how much effort was needed. The models make the logic of the program more accessible to coders who did not worked on that specific piece of code previously, which can increase the possibility of code review and improving logic. The case study was a University CubeSat team, where team members join the project as a part of their thesis, while the project continues for 2-3 years, and modeling the code logic can reduce some of the onboarding effort required when new members want to reuse or improve on existing codebase.",

    "description": "Successful Capella landing on a CNES operational use case\n\nBy Jonathan Lasalle (Artal/Magellium)\n\nThe Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a space system dedicated to gamma-ray detection and study, under development by China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the French Space Agency (CNES), to be launched in 2021. The system shall be able to trigger alerts of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) in real-time with a maximum of associated data. It is composed of a space segment (a set of various sensors embedded on a satellite) associated with a worldwide antenna ground network, all managed by the two agencies.\n\nThe design of this system was conducted within the framework of the CNES engineering process, based on a set of documents cascading the textual requirements from the high-level concept of operations to the technical specification of equipment. The validation of the obtained specification mainly relies on human expertise and on the validation campaign. The complexity of the system made it a perfect candidate for experimentation of MBSE using Capella. Two projects took place successively in this context: a first one was an R&T study, dedicated to the analysis of the current process and the evaluation of the potential benefits that MBSE could bring (restricted to some part of the system but spread on several engineering layers (architecture, simulation, satellite database definition...)). Due to promising results, a second project, based on the models realized during the first study, was dedicated to the operational capture of the system validation.\n\nThe smooth incursion of Capella in CNES engineering process was undeniably well received. The SVOM experts were converted to this new way of working. The building of an operational model-based toolchain to capture the system architecture and its associated V&V specification is an achievement that opens the door to a wider reach of MBSE within CNES.\n\nSessions slides: https://bit.ly/capelladays2020_artal_slides\n\nAll the Capella Days slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020\n\nCreative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

These industries however typically develop their systems with very large, one-of-a-kind system projects, following the V model. A large upfront (MB)SE effort is justified then as the cost of late failures are extremely high.\n\nThe High-Tech Equipment Industry on the other hand develops its systems incrementally with an agile Systems Engineering process, supporting many product variants and often a configure-to-order sales process.\n\nHow does MBSE match up with the characteristics of the High-Tech Equipment Industry? ESI and its partners have started a collaborative project to study together whether, and if so how, MBSE, or MBSE elements, can improve Systems Engineering in this industry business context.\n\nThis talk will provide an update on the state of SE in the High-Tech Equipment Industry, its use of models, and the outlook on the fit of MBSE in this industry context.\n\nSession slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/capella-days-2020-mbse-and-the-hightech-equipment-industry-how-do-they-match-up\n\nAll slides from Capella Days 2020: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020\n\nCreative Commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

If we don’t take action, in 2050, there will be more plastic than fishes in the oceans!\n\nThe SeaCleaners association has been founded to provide global, long-term, and worldwide solutions for fighting against ocean plastic pollution. The flagship project initiated by The SeaCleaners is the MANTA, the first seagoing vessel capable of collecting and processing in continuous flow large quantities of macro plastic waste floating at the surface of oceans. Its design has been focusing on many innovative technologies in the field of renewable energy production or by limiting her global carbon footprint maximizing energy self-sufficiency.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a Capella extension developed by Obeo in partnership with The SeaCleaners and Altran to facilitate the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) of complex systems. This extension consists of additional concepts added to Capella for inventorying components' physical characteristics and the substances they consume and/or emit. This information attached to the system architecture can be automatically exported as an initial inventory analysis to LCA tools used by environmental experts to perform their impact analysis (such as SimaPro and OpenLCA).\n\nExperimented on a MANTA subsystem, we will show how this integration between Capella and LCA Tools accelerates the evaluation of the impacts a system has on its environment and helps system designers to make architecture decisions that are better for the planet.\n\nSession slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/capella-days-2020-integrating-mbse-and-life-cycle-assessment-for-removing-plastics-from-the-oceans-with-the-seacleaners\n\nAll the slides from Capella Days 2020: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020\n\nCreative Commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

Sept ans après, la solution Capella est désormais confortablement installée sur le marché des solutions d’architecture de systèmes industriels, avec plusieurs centaines d’organisations utilisatrices sur tous les continents. Issu d’une collaboration entamée plusieurs années auparavant entre le grand groupe international d’ingénierie et une jeune startup nantaise, Capella est un atelier d’ingénierie système (MBSE) permettant de définir l’architecture de systèmes complexes dans des domaines tels que le spatial, les transports, la santé ou les télécoms. Avec ce talk, nous reviendrons sur la genèse du projet et la stratégie mise en œuvre pour sa mise en open-source. En particulier, comment Thales et Obeo collaborent étroitement pour faire évoluer Capella, assurer sa promotion au niveau international et développer un écosystème riche et diversifié à même d’accompagner les démarches de découverte, d’adoption et de déploiement.\n\nEtienne JULIOT - Vice-Président - Obeo\nJuan NAVAS - Modelling & Simulation Lead Expert - Thales",

    "description": "Realization of Model-Based Safety Analysis and Integration with Capella\nby MARK ZELLER, Siemens CT\n\nThe importance of mission or safety-critical software systems in many application domains of embedded systems is continuously growing, and so is the effort and complexity for reliability and safety analysis. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) is currently one of the key approaches to cope with increasing system complexity.\n\nWith Component Fault Trees (CFTs) there is a model- and component-based methodology for safety analysis, which extends the advantages of model-based development to safety & reliability engineering. In this talk, we demonstrate how to ease the development of safety-critical systems by implementing a graphical modeling tool for Component Fault Trees using Sirius and integrate safety analysis capabilities in a model-based system engineering workflow in Capella.\n\nMark Zeller, Siemens CT\nMarc Zeller works as a Senior Key Expert for model-based safety and reliability engineering at Siemens Corporate Technology. His research interests are focused on the efficient and effective development of dependability-relevant Cyber-physical Systems using model-based engineering techniques. Marc Zeller received a diploma in Computer Science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2007 and obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Augsburg in 2013. With over 10-years' experience in different industrial domains, such as automotive, railway, avionics, or industry automations, he has been involved in various projects establishing model-based engineering techniques and is author of many publications in this area.",
