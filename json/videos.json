    "description": "Presented by Gerardo de Jesus Ramirez & Juan Felipe Rios\nHosted by Martin Lebourgeois\n\n***\nThe use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically VTOLs, in search and rescue missions is key for quickly locating victims in emergencies. This presentation will focus on designing and validating an integrated system, composed of search and rescue drones, utilizing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with Capella to ensure coordination between mission components. Capella ensures all elements work together efficiently, optimizing response in critical situations.\nSearch drones, equipped with high-resolution cameras, thermal sensors, and GPS, detect, track, and map difficult-to-reach areas, facilitating precise identification of victims in complex environments. Capella ensures the correct integration of these drones with other mission systems, such as rescue drones and ground teams, ensuring smooth transfer of critical data like victims' location and terrain conditions. This optimizes decision-making and real-time coordination, maximizing mission effectiveness.\nThe rescue drone, in addition to transporting medical supplies, can carry two rescuers directly to the victim for necessary rescue and evacuation tasks. Capella facilitates traceability of requirements for both systems (search and rescue), addressing critical aspects for mission success.\nIntegrating advanced technologies like AI and machine learning enhances real-time decision-making, improving victim detection. Using MBSE and Capella ensures that each system component is validated and effectively integrated into the mission, which is crucial for increasing rescue mission effectiveness.\n\nPresentation slides: https://mbse-capella.org/resources/pdf/webinars/20250206_CapellaWebinar_Slides_Speaker.pdf \n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/  \nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction & Abstract\n2:00 - Summary\n3:01 - Presentation of the speakers\n4:02 - Introduction to the context\n6:22 - Why choose MBSE and Capella?\n7:25 - Problem context : Challenges in Search and Rescue Missions\n13:02 - Operational Overview\n17:39 - MBSE implementation : Arcadia Method\n18:50 - MBSE implementation : Operational Analysis\n27:17 - MBSE implementation : System Analysis\n30:20 - MBSE implementation : Logical Architecture\n31:14 - MBSE implementation : Physical Architecture \n34:48 - Conclusion \n38:12 - Futur Work of the speakers \n39:50 - Q&A: Did you consider helicopter interactions and airspace conflicts in your modeling?\n40:42 - Q&A: Can you detail your role in rescue missions?\n41:42 - Q&A: Did you model the operational capacities?\n42:31 - Q&A: Shouldn't the model anticipate disruptions to ensure validity in real conditions?\n43:42 - Q&A: Did you use a tool to integrate OpenVSP or Simulink into MBSE?\n44:20 - Q&A: Did the model consider non-functional requirements like cost and weight?\n45:31 - Q&A: Why define drone concepts in operational analysis?\n46:50- Q&A: How exactly did the Python and MATLAB help your Model?\n47:47 - Outro\n***",

To accomplish this task, a System Definition process was undertaken to achieve the Engineering solution space domain. And to achieve the System Definition methodology the author decided to focus on first creating an Interface Control Document that consisted of high-level overview architecture of the target system CLEA (Digital Building Logbook) and the source system BDNB (Base de Données Nationale des Bâtiments). \n\nHowever, the alternative architectures presented challenges such as how to validate the requirements at this stage. The chosen tool/technique was THALES (Model-Based System Engineering) – Capella Tool and Arcadia Methodology. The article presents this approach, which included: operational analysis, system needs analysis, logical architecture and discussions reflecting the physical architecture relating to the requirement phases of need understanding and solution architecture design. The outcome of this presentation is The French Demonstration Preliminary Requirements and acknowledgement to the benefits of MBSE: Improved communications, Increased ability to manage system complexity, Improved product quality, Reduced Recycled Time, Reduced Risk, Enhanced knowledge capture and reuse of the information.\n\nPresentation slides: https://mbse-capella.org/resources/pdf/webinars/20250515_CapellaWebinar_Slides_Speaker.pdf\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/  \nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction & Abstract\n0:44 - Baseline : Systematic and Systemic Thinking\n7:23 - Personal Experience with Capella\n9:26 - Case Study 1 : Live Project (Demo Blog)\n10:08 - What is a Digital Building Logbook?\n13:55 -  Why Systems Engineering?\n16:49 - Diagram for Systems Requirements \n18:02 - Digital Models \n19:40 - How Did I Improve the Situation?\n20:54 - Workflow Structure\n21:49 - Operational Analysis\n24:15 - System Analysis\n25:25 - Logical Architecture\n28:34 - Physical Architecture\n29:10 - Building Real-Time Recommendation Application\n30:16 - MBSE : The Arcadia Perspectives\n32:15 - Case Study 2 : Horizon Europe Proposal \n34:45 - Systems Engineering Principles\n39:34 - Storyboards with Capella\n40:58 - System Architecture\n47:04 - Systems Engineering and SEBoK\n48:20 - Q&A: Could the Capella diagrams be shared?\n50:08 - Outro\n***",

    "description": "Presented by Ilyes Yousfi\nHosted by Martin Le Bourgeois\n\n***\nModern systems have become more and more complex, requiring the use of a wide range of tools to successfully manage their development. Considering this situation, seamless connectivity and interactions between those tools is of paramount importance to build a consistent and valuable digital thread.\n \nAs many development programs involve different organizations, there is also a growing need for connecting digital threads together to facilitate decision making. This poses a challenge of building interoperable toolchains that enable collaboration, data exchange and global configuration management along the system life cycle.\n \nCapella, while offering an excellent framework for program collaboration and systems of systems development with the ARCADIA Method, can participate in this endeavour by being integrated into a Synchronized Source of Truth (SSoT) that gathers all systems engineering assets. Some tasks and processes that would nurture this synchronized repository are:\n•        Bi-directional System/System element requirements synchronization and traceability,\n•        Requirements attributes and consistency check\n•        Model synchronization between organizations\n•        Model conversion (SysML to ARCADIA)\n•        Life Cycle-wide configuration management.\n•        Model element reports publication.\n \nThis talk will show how the integration of Capella models into SES ENGINEERING Studio’s multi-activity platform can benefit to collaborating organizations in development programs, ensuring data exchange and synchronization as well as ontology-controlled requirements management.\n\nPresentation slides: https://mbse-capella.org/resources/pdf/webinars/20250403_CapellaWebinar_Slides_Speaker.pdf\n\nQ&A: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/t/webinar-march-13th-2025-smw-aligning-configurations-enhancing-collaboration-and-improving-user-experience/10444\n\n***\nStay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/  \nCapella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/\n\n***\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction & Abstract\n1:38 - Digital Thread : cope with complex systems development\n8:40 - Synchronized Source of Truth : The Fondations of the Digital Thread\n17:10 - Use case : Connection to a Capella Model\n23:09 - Use case : Connection to an ALM Tool project (Polarion)\n28:05 - Extended Traceability: Ensure Model-Requirement Consistency  \n30:36 - Use case : Polarion - Capella Traceability\n34:52 - Use case : Requirement-model consistency\n37:28 - Model-requirement consistency : Unlocking Interoperability\n42:50 - Use case : Zig-zag Polarion - Capella\n47:21 - Use case : SES Remote connector \n50:06 - Q&A: Is SSoT a commercial tool?\n50:23 - Q&A: How does this fit data security with changing access?\n51:48 - Q&A: How do we integrate with existing enterprise workflows ?\n53:09 - Q&A: Do you have a method for choosing sources and handling contradictions? \n55:28 - Q&A: Can new info in one tool create elements in others, or is it just linking?\n56:45 - Outro\n***",

But what if it did not have to be this way?<br><br>At GU Orbit, we have adopted the Arcadia method exactly to make the process of engineering complex space systems more accessible to undergraduate students. With its multi-level workflow, repetitive activities, and opinionated semantics enforced by the Capella tool, it effectively guides even inexperienced users in the design of rational systems. Additionally, taking advantage of its semantic similarity to the European Space Agency's TASTE toolchain for embedded software development, we have devised an overarching methodology to rigorously bridge the gap between high-level system specifications and low-level component code.<br><br>This Arcadia-based method comprises the entire systems engineering lifecycle in a unified V-shaped model. The design phase is performed in Capella, regularly traversing all main functional decomposition levels. Specific physical-level views are then used to translate the resulting model into TASTE, trivialising the implementation phase down to individual lines of code in the Specification and Description Language (SDL, ITU-T Z.100) and C/C++. Finally, the verification and validation phases are carried out at all levels of abstraction by comparing specific TASTE-generated diagrams, such as State Chart Views and Message Sequence Charts (MSC, ITU-T Z.120), against their Capella-defined counterparts.<br><br>In this webinar, we will illustrate this method in the context of GU Orbit's student-led development of autonomous nanosatellite avionics, which were successfully demonstrated during an early stratospheric balloon flight.<br><br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/<br><br>***<br>Chapters: <br>0:00 - Introduction and Contents<br>1:20 - Presenting the Team and the Project<br>9:49 - MBSE Adoption<br>22:05 - Embedded Systems Development and \"Bridging the Gap\"<br>56:50 - Q&A: What platforms used other than MSP-430?<br>57:34 - Q&A: Are any of the models available?<br>58:20 - Q&A: Did you try formal verification in TASTE?<br>1:00:16 - Q&A: How to incorporate HW elements in TASTE?",

    "description": "Presented by Dr. Eric Dano<br>Hosted by Laurent Delaigue<br><br>Slides available here: https://bit.ly/capella_webinar_231005<br><br>***<br><br>System Architecture, its derived requirements and systems analysis performed, are often attributed to defining 70% of the cost and capabilities of a system. However, after nearly two decades of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), there is a lack of architecture focused methodologies and tools to aid programs in creating a robust, transdisciplinary system architecture. <br><br>One notable exception is the Thales developed Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) method and associated Capella modeling tool. The ARCADIA Architecture Development Method (ADM) provides instance-based methodologies for each ADM step with rich viewpoints and views to ensure a robust architecture is obtained. As the goal of the proposed methodology is to rapidly create a robust, transdisciplinary system architecture, ARCADIA was selected for its native alignment with this goal. <br><br>However, the ARCADIA method is like a framework and requires a defined methodology to be applied to it to determine what views, and in what order, constitutes the desired architectural model. <br><br>The proposed methodology defined these elements based on alignment with the IEEE 15288:2015 architecture standard, and to further the goals of ease of learning, rapid modeling, and reduced modeler workload/errors.<br><br>Dr. Dano's Capella model : https://obeo-mirror-capella-releases.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/models/Missing_Person_Locator_Example.zip<br><br>***<br>Chapters:<br>0:00 - Intro<br>0:25 - Speakers Introduction<br>1:27 - Motivation behind the project<br>3:40 - Outline<br>3:56 - System Architecture Definition<br>5:30 - Goal of the Proposed Methodology<br>9:30 - Advantages of Capella<br>12:35 - Proposed Methodology<br>14:25 - Example: MPL System<br>14:58 - Main presentation<br>37:14 - Example: \"Ility\" Supplemental View<br>39:43 - Conclusion<br>42:46 - Q&A: State Machines<br>44:40 - Q&A: How to customize Arcadia for small companies<br>46:14 - Q&A: Using ARCADIA to adress DODAF Services viewpoints<br>47:05 - Q&A: Did you connect requirements with architecture element<br>48:30 - Q&A: How many levels of function in the model?<br>49:49 - Q&A: Does Arcadia have a define ontology?<br>50:38 - Q&A: Is there any challenged not addressed by the tool?<br>52:11 - Q&A: Advantages of Capella/ARCADIA compared to OPM<br>53:36- Q&A: Once the system architecture is iterated and developed using Arcadia capella, how does it get translated down the line ?<br>56:22 - Q&A: Engraining testability at the start of modelling activities<br>57:40 - Outro<br>***",

Does your system require interaction with other systems to operate safely?<br>Does the design and operational concept of the system include contingency means? Do these contingency means correctly mitigate the risks?<br><br>These and other similar considerations are becoming more important with the emergence of autonomous systems and complex systems of systems. The introduction of digital tools and in particular model-based systems engineering allows to capture the complexity of these products starting from the operational analysis and supporting the process throughout the whole product life cycle.<br><br>With ATICA, system architects and designers will be able to analyze safety implications starting from the conceptual needs and mission description; modeling risks associated to the system, assessing the probability of occurrence and severity, and deciding upon the needs of contingency and mitigation means.

    "title": "Making Arcadia work for you - a look at framework tailoring in Thales UK | Thales | Capella Webinar",
    "description": "Presented by Alex Laing and Andrew Pemberton from Thales UK<br><br>*<br><br>Architecture frameworks provide an approach to describing systems and the presentation of these elements and relationships to deliver the stakeholder needs. Essentially, frameworks provide templates for our engineering artefacts.<br><br>The design of a framework must accommodate a level of freedom in its usage; specific enough to answer the majority of stakeholder concerns, whilst generic enough to allow for differences between projects. This balancing act often results in framework design being more generic to allow for a wider audience. Having an untailored framework, which is more ‘open’, can lead to creating inconsistent viewpoints.<br><br>Arcadia is one such framework as implemented through the Capella tool. The framework provides 4 perspectives/levels for product definition:<br>- The Operational Analysis, where the user needs are considered. Note: no concept of the System at this level.<br>- The System Analysis, where we define the contribution and scope of the System as a ‘black box’, identifying external interfaces, and top-level system functions.<br>- The Logical Architecture, where we break the System down into logical ‘blocks’ and decompose the functionality.<br>- The Physical Architecture, in which we define a (candidate) physical architecture, further decompose the functions, and deploy this functionality to the physical sub-systems, hardware, software and/or firmware.<br><br>In this talk, we acknowledge the strengths of the Arcadia framework, and the benefits it brings, whilst considering the need to tailor the generic viewpoints. We will provide examples of how we have adopted the generic Arcadia framework and further specified some of the viewpoints to meet the needs of our stakeholders. We will discuss future work looking at how we can translate these specialisations across other areas of the model.

    "description": "Presented by: Michael Schäfer<br>***<br>Als vor einigen Jahren in Nordeuropa ein großes Projekt im Bereich der Leit- und Sicherungstechnik für Eisenbahnen ausgeschrieben war, hat Thales sich an diesem Projekt beteiligt und dort zum ersten Mal in einer Angebotsphase ARCADIA als Methodik und Capella® als Tool für Model-Based-System-Engineering eingesetzt. Auf den Capella Days 2018 wurden von uns die Ergebnisse dieses Einsatzes vorgestellt. In der Zwischenzeit hat sich nun dieses Angebotsprojekt in ein reales Projekt verwandelt.<br><br>Damit stellte sich für uns bei Thales die Frage, wie arbeiten wir in ARCADIA und Capella® weiter. Der Vortrag zeigt daher den \"langen Weg\" vom Angebotsmodell zum einem Projektmodell in Capella®. Neben Fragen wie \"Was kann aus dem Angebotsmodell wiederverwendet werden?\" oder \"Wie können wir die Anzahl der Systemarchitekten, die an dem Projekt arbeiten, schnell erhöhen?\", werden auch einige der Fallstricke auf diesem Weg präsentiert.<br><br>Zusätzlich gibt dieser Vortrag Antworten auf Fragen wie \"Welche der verschiedenen Sichten von ARCADIA sind für welchen Zweck geeignet?\" oder \"Wie kann man spezielle Themen wie die Kommunikation mit Kunden, die Beschreibung externer Schnittstellen oder Sicherheitsaspekte für ein großes Eisenbahnverkehrsmanagementsystem modellieren?\".<br><br>Seminar Kernaussagen<br>Folgende Kernaussagen ergeben sich aus den Erfahrungen des Einsatzes von ARCADIA und Capella® auch in frühen Phasen eines Projekts:<br><br>- Die Methodik und das Tool lassen sich gewinnbringend auch in einer Angebotsphase einsetzen, wenn man sich auf die notwendigen Teile beschränkt, damit das Angebotsteam eine einheitliche Sicht auf den Entwurf erhält.<br>- Dieses Angebotsmodell lässt sich im Umsetzungsprojekt weiterverwenden, wobei der Fokus auf den funktionalen Aspekten und deren Beschreibung liegt.<br>- Als hilfreich hat sich eine Fokussierung auf kritische Bereiche herausgestellt, z.B. auf Funktionen, die eine Sicherheitsrelevanz tragen.<br>- Als Herausforderung stellt sich auch hier der notwendige kulturelle Wandel von einem textuellen, dokumentenzentrierten Vorgehen zu einem modellbasierten Vorgehen.<br>***<br>Follow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:<br><br>Blog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-m...<br>Twitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

    "description": "Presented by Sébastien Dubé from SAMARES<br><br>*<br>Slides: https://bit.ly/capella_webinar_220922_slides<br>*<br><br>\"How to efficiently apply recommended practices of Systems Engineering: The Health Agriculture UAV case study<br><br>With the emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (computer systems in which physical elements are controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms), defining a solution which satisfies stakeholder needs and various constraints is a hard task to complete. This is the reason why the Systems Engineering community defined standardized practices (such as the ones defined in ISO15288:2015), to realize successful systems, several years ago.<br><br>However, performing these practices with the traditional \"\"document based\"\" approach may be limited due to the difficulty of checking the overall consistency of the engineering documents. Using MBSE methods and tools (such as proposed by the ARCADIA method and Capella tool) is a great help to support the stakeholder requirements analysis and system requirements / architecture definition. However, it is sometimes difficult to \"\"map/instantiate\"\" the standard processes (ISO15288:2015) to implementation using ARCADIA method and Capella, especially when adapted to the specific practices of each company. <br><br>During this talk, you will gain insights concerning the relations between the ISO15288:2015 processes and the ARCADIA approach, illustrated using the Health Agriculture UAV case study and focus on some common topics such as implementation of MOEs/MOPs in the model. \"<br><br>*<br>Follow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:<br><br>Blog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Twitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia<br><br>*",

However, truth is not exclusively found within models. The need to describe external contracts, regulations, or non-functional requirements, for instance, can be more efficiently satisfied by using textual specifications. In order to achieve the desired “Common Source of Truth”, model and textual requirements must be connected and coexist, desirable enhanced by the automatization of the consistency checking, automatically modifying one side when changes are produced on the other end...<br><br>Within The REUSE Company, we have realised how crucial it is to facilitate this connection and provide Systems Engineers with the tools required for applying SE across the entire process as seamlessly as possible. This solution is the SES ENGINEERING Studio, and within this webinar, the following capabilities will be shown:<br><br>- The SES ENGINEERING Studio offers the capability to assess consistency between textual requirements and Capella models.<br>- Automatic generation of Capella models from Textual Requirements inside an RMS (Requirements Management System). This also involves the possibility to complete the exact opposite operation, generating textual requirements from Capella models.<br>- Seamless traceability management between textual requirements (in any RMS) and model elements in Capella; This includes the possibility to automatically suggest traces based on the semantic content of the textual requirement.<br>- If the preferred option is to maintain these textual requirements inside Capella, we offer the possibility to provide a round-trip process between any RMS and Requirements Viewpoint within Capella; thus, allowing that modification at either end, to be synchronized.<br>- Automatic quality assessment of Capella models following a number of pre-established rules or allowing the users to define tailored rules.<br>- Automatic interoperability between SysML and Arcadia models.<br><br>***<br>Follow us on our blog and different social networks to stay up to date on upcoming Capella events:<br><br>Blog : https://blog.obeosoft.com/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Twitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia<br><br>***",

Effective management of complex interdependencies is crucial, aided by System Architectures (SA) and Interface Control Documents (ICD) that ensure consistency and collaboration. A system model with a derivation framework further enhances efficiency and provides a single source of truth.<br><br>Pixxel's framework combines the ARCADIA method with the Capella tool to address challenges in subsystem integration and mission planning. A hypothetical imaging satellite design demonstrates this approach, starting with Mission Requirements and leading to a Reference Mission Profile. Functional aspects of the Spacecraft and Ground Segment are modeled in Capella, with established design patterns directly incorporated into System Architecture Blank (SAB) and Exchange Scenarios (ES). New requirements are addressed using the System Dataflow Diagram (SDFB) before integration into SAB and ES diagrams, effectively representing the Reference Mission and Architecture.<br><br>A well-defined Mission Architecture ensures consistent traceability across all levels. Telemetry and telecommand interfaces are formalized using Capella's Contextual Internal Interface (CII) and Contextual External Interface (CEI) diagrams, with standardized templates enhancing clarity and reusability.<br><br>Imaging satellites require capabilities such as Power Generation, Orbit Maintenance, Pointing, Thermal Control, Command and Data Handling, Payload Operation, and Launch Lifecycle. These are categorized as Capella System Capabilities, making the system model straightforward to navigate and applicable across missions. The technology-agnostic logical-level decomposition and standardized architectural viewpoints ensure a cohesive, reusable framework.

This presentation explores the reengineering of a quality test machine for bottles using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using Capella.<br><br>At the beginning the quality test machine is introduced, detailing its current functionalities and the challenges necessitating its improvement. Using Capella, the existing system is modeled with the aim to create a comprehensive representation of the machine's current state. This model serves as the foundation for identifying improvement opportunities and defining the system's constraints and potential areas for optimization. Subsequently, a model with the proposed enhancements is developed and presented.<br><br>Based on this example, the talk will elaborate how Model-Based System Engineering can be applied in an industrial manufacturing context. The principles and methodologies employed in this case study can be generalized to reengineer a wide range of industrial equipment, from assembly lines to packaging systems. By systematically modeling existing systems, identifying areas for improvement, and simulating proposed changes, MBSE provides a structured and scalable approach that can be adapted to different types of machinery and production environments.<br><br>Attendees will gain insights into how a model-based approach, particularly through the use of Capella, structures and therefore simplifies the reengineering process.

One of the problems to be solved in order to fully succeed in this transition is information confidentiality management. It is also necessary to propose a system design process that allows an evolution through the whole design life cycle, and that guarantees a coherent design for a given level of confidentiality. To the best of our knowledge, neither current Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) tools, nor academic research propose solutions to this specific issue.<br><br>In this paper, we propose a model-based system design process to manage elements belonging to different levels of confidentiality. The process guarantees a plurality of confidentiality levels in line with Bell-Lapadula security policies for the secure management of system design and specification, as required for the protection of national and coalition defense information. It includes the separation into enclaves and adaptations guaranteeing the preservation of confidentiality and integrity to authorized users. We describe how this process can be leveraged for current modelling tools by exploiting existing multi-user functionality.<br>*** <br><br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here: <br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/ <br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/ <br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/ <br><br>*** <br>Chapters: <br>0:00 - Introduction<br>2:30 - MBSE Confidentiality Management: Problem statement<br>10:50 - MBSE Confidentiality Management: Solution proposal<br>15:41 - MBSE Confidentiality Management: Application example<br>17:50 - MBSE Confidentiality Management: Current modelling tools integration<br>19:21 - MBSE Confidentiality Management: Conclusion<br>20:33 - Security Analysis of Capella Designs: Problem Statement<br>23:45 - Security Analysis of Capella Designs: Security Requirements Elicitation<br>27:15 - Tool implementation: Analysis from Capella Designs<br>28:34 - Secured Functional Chain<br>29:25 - \"Big Picture\" of the solution<br>33:42 - Short Demo<br>37:42 - Perspectives<br>41:35 - Conclusion<br>43:02 - Q&A: Transforming your proof of concept into an add-on<br>***",

Historically, the product design and validation processes have been reliant on cross-functional engineering teams collaborating with standalone documentations/systems thus making it slower and ineffective to do design iteration.<br><br>Using a case-study from the semiconductor equipment industry, our presentation describes a method of leveraging Capella MBSE models to streamline the Product Development process by establishing end to end traceability from Requirements to MBSE Models to CAD and CAE digital artifacts. Utilizing Teamcenter, Pycapellambse, Jupyter Notebook, we automated the extraction of vital MBSE model objects and its design parameters, essential for generating the relevant input for CAE analysis. Also seamlessly integrating Capella (SMW) into Teamcenter where Requirements and CAD artifacts are managed thus enabling the creation of Digital Thread. Having this type of tight connections between various digital artifacts from upstream to downstream in an enterprise level PLM system provides the much-needed data accessibility, fidelity and helps Engineers do quick Impact Analysis when there is a request for change in requirements or design.<br><br>This presentation will offer participants:<br><br>1. The significance and role of MBSE models in building a robust Digital Thread.<br>2. An overview of our Teamcenter based solution, shedding light on how we author, manage and integrate Requirements and CAD objects with MBSE models from Capella.<br>3. Demonstrable advantages, insights, and takeaways from our semiconductor equipment industry case study, underscoring the transformative power of Digital Thread leveraging MBSE in accuracy, efficiency, and traceability.<br>*** <br><br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here: <br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/ <br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/ <br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/ <br><br>*** <br>Chapters:<br>0:00 - Intro<br>0:49 - Context and Challenges<br>5:29 - Solution: Transition to MBSE<br>10:10 - Product architectures in SMW<br>11:32 - MBSE: foundation of Digital Thread<br>14:46 - Traceability <br>18:37 - Connecting designs<br>20:47 - Integrated Parameter Management<br>23:21 - Simulation Digital Thread<br>28:23 - Conclusions<br>33:46 - What's Next?<br>38:01 - Q&A: Any benefits for the non-SE?<br>39:13 - Q&A: How tedious was setting up the tracelinks?<br>40:30 - Q&A: Any resistance to the adoption of MBSE and requirements linking?<br>42:42 - Q&A: How do you approach model creation?<br>46:05 - Q&A: Limitations in py-capellambse<br><br>***",

To manage the complexity of the challenge at hand we adopted a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach and created an own engineering environment around Capella.<br><br>We use Capella for both internal development projects and together with our partners within Europe Rail Joint Undertaking. Due to the complexity of our environment Capella alone was not enough so we developed an engineering environment around Capella and integrated it with the rest of our engineering toolchain. Most of the bespoke development we've done is public on GitHub.<br><br>However, scaling MBSE up across a large organization presents unique challenges. These include enabling collaboration on models across different organizations, making MBSE content accessible to non-MBSE stakeholders, and addressing the need for efficient training. Our presentation outlines our strategies to overcome these challenges:<br><br>- Capella Collaboration Manager: An environment designed to reduce the entry barriers for MBSE. We'll demonstrate how users can quickly get into Capella and related tools without installing anything locally, automate tasks, and collaborate in real-time by sharing sessions with other users.<br>- Model Accessibility for Non-MBSE Stakeholders: We will showcase how to make MBSE content more accessible for a broader audience: communicating and reviewing model-derived deliverables, discussing content through comment threads, producing evidence of review, and tracking model changes.<br>- Scalable Training Solutions: As we prepare to launch multiple projects simultaneously, the need to onboard and train a large number of project engineers is critical. We will present our self-led, on-demand training solution that offers hands-on experience.<br><br>This talk will provide valuable insights into how we address these challenges, ensuring that MBSE can be scaled effectively to support the digital transformation of Germany's railway system.<br>*** <br><br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here: <br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/ <br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/ <br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/ <br><br>*** <br>Chapters: <br>0:00 - Agenda<br>0:55 - Introduction<br>3:08 - Challenges and our motivation for custom solution<br>5:06 - Demo: Enabling easy co-working with a browser running tool<br>13:11 - Making models useful for general engineering crowd<br>17:04 - Demo: Exploring Capella models as documents<br>21:16 - Demo: Capella to Polarion<br>25:08 - Demo: Model automation<br>27:20 - Hands-on experience for project teams<br>32:54 - Demo: Capella Collaboration Manager on-demand training<br>38:13 - What's next?<br>39:25 - Q&A: How long to establish your MBSE workflow? <br>40:14 - Q&A: Maintaining the training section<br>41:42 - Q&A: Using py-capellambse library to create models<br>42:38 - Q&A: Any future improvements?<br>43:12 - Q&A: How many active users at DB?<br>***",

It will detect precursors of earthquakes in the ionosphere. We have started using Capella in last year and so far, we are using Capella for software development. It is a big problem for university-developed nanosatellites that the mission failure rate is more than 50%. The software controls the satellite once it is in orbit and it is not easy to reprogram, so it is important to make it flexible and robust. We use Capella to do that.<br><br>Software design can be difficult because programmers don't always see the big picture. It is hard to know if the software will meet all the requirements. Requirements can be divided into functional and non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. Although functional requirements are easy to find from a user’s point of view, non-functional requirements are difficult to find. In this scene, Capella can be used effectively because it has both a black-box approach, which reveals user needs, and a white-box approach, which is important for thinking about the internal system. Our satellite’s software has a layered architecture where each layer is compatible with Arcadia. For example, the logical layer in Capella is referenced when we write code for the driver layer. This methodology addresses the challenges of software development.<br><br>We are also looking at using Team for Capella to create a complete satellite model. This is a big challenge for university labs, where the knowledge base gets weaker with each new group of graduates. Not only that, building the whole system model helps us to share knowledge and understand the system better, which helps us to make it better.<br>*** <br><br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here: <br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/ <br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/ <br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/ <br><br>*** <br>Chapters: <br>0:00 - Outline<br>1:14 - Speakers and project introduction<br>4:40 - Why we adapted capella: CubeSats definition and what we hope to achieve<br>13:30 - About our CubeSat PRELUDE<br>18:02 - Arcadia Method<br>19:00 - Our Capella Models: Operational, System and logical Layers<br>24:55 - Keywords and Software design<br>30:55 - Conclusion: What we achieved and future work<br>33:03 - Q&A: Did you exchanged models with others organizations?<br>33:29 - Q&A: Modelling variations with PLM approach<br>34:20 - Q&A: Converting Capella model to code<br>34:45 - Q&A: The decision to introduce reusability?<br>35:27 - Q&A: One or multiple modeler in the team?<br>36:12 - Q&A: How responsive was people to your model?<br>37:04 - Q&A: Any integrated elements in your SE solution?<br>***",

Marine shipping accounts for ~ 2.89% of global CO2e emissions in 2018, which is ~11% of the global transportation CO2e emissions in 2020. After the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the “Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships” in 2018, the strategy was revised in 2023 and now aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050.<br><br>Reaching this target demands enhanced operational efficiency, compliance with increasingly stringent regulations, as well as the integration and alignment of different systems within a complex network of stakeholders. New approaches are needed to manage the increasing complexity of the maritime industry and ship development, as the traditional ship design process lacks the ability to describe the operational context, stakeholder interactions, or alternative design options. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approaches, such as the Arcadia method, offer a promising strategy to gain a better understanding of the as-is situation and to develop advanced solutions.<br><br>This case study demonstrates the application of the Arcadia method for the maritime industry, focusing on the creation of a Siemens system modeling workbench (SMW) system architecture model and its integration into Siemens Teamcenter to realize a comprehensive product lifecycle management (PLM) approach. Selected system model elements are linked with other development artifacts such as requirements in order to demonstrate the possibilities of using system architecture models in ship development.

The Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) hosts SIRIUS, one of the few 4th-generation synchrotron light sources in operation worldwide, allowing much faster and precise experiments.<br><br>To fully exploit the capabilities of this advanced facility, experimental systems such as beamlines and end stations are required to meet stringent mechanical, thermal, and optical performance criteria. They now feature significantly more complex architecture and design, sometimes requiring position resolution and stability as fine as a few nanometers, and data acquisition rates of several kHz.<br><br>In response to this growing complexity, a system engineering workflow has been developed and is currently under evaluation by one of SIRIUS engineering teams. The workflow encompasses the beginning of the project lifecycle, from user needs assessment to high-level design , also including requirements management and early trade-off analyses. The last is only possible due to the possibilities offered by MBSE tools, which allow the connection between different engineering models, from different specialties. Nevertheless, the requirements management must accommodate the communication or knowledge transfer between scientific and engineering stakeholders, which also imposes a challenge to the workflow. To deal with these different aspects of the project, a connected software ecosystem is proposed, integrating tools such as Capella, Ansys ModelCenter and TraceCloud.

The growing complexity of these systems, coupled with the criticality of their performance, necessitates advanced tools and techniques for troubleshooting failures and minimizing unexpected downtimes. Additionally, it is challenging to scale service organizations to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding installed base. To address these needs, we propose a model-driven methodology for diagnostics, in which, via a digital diagnostic reasoning system, we leverage design information to assist the service engineer in the troubleshooting process.<br><br>A diagnostic model is at the core of the proposed methodology. This model mainly contains information on the functional dependencies between the different subsystems and modules in the system. The structure of the model is based on the system’s functional breakdown, functional exchanges and the deployment on hardware, as they are modelled in Capella. Information about system observables and tests is added to relate field observations to the appropriate system functions. Upon usage, the observations from a troubled system in the field are provided to such a diagnostic model, which then uses the functional dependencies to reason over the possible root-causes.<br><br>In this talk, we will show how we use Capella as the main source of information for our diagnostic models and illustrate the use of such a model through a demo.

CERN’s scientific activities currently produce up to 640 tons of radioactive waste (RW) per year, which are generated by the interaction between high energy particles and equipment present inside the accelerator complex. CERN reuses activated material as far as possible, the rest that cannot be reused or recycled is eliminated in dedicated disposal facilities for radioactive waste of the two Host States, France and Switzerland. <br><br>The ARCADIA methodology and the Capella tool were used for the first time by the CERN Radiation Protection Group to conceive and specify an effective process for the elimination by melting of metallic radioactive waste. A project was launched accordingly in 2019, whose aim was to prove the feasibility of the new process, termed “MAST” (Melting of Activated STeel). As a result, a batch of 19 m3 of Low-Level/Intermediate-Level metallic radioactive waste was successfully selected, characterized and then melted at the end of 2022, resulting in 8.3 ingots (1.9 m3) and 0.15 m3 of slag that were successfully disposed of in June 2023. <br><br>This talk provides an overview of how the ARCADIA methodology guided in the development of a complex RW industrial process as MAST by means of graphical elements alone. The Capella software was instrumental, providing a rich set of diagrams that covered all the design needs; it generated automatically a textual specification of the process that was required by the auditing French Authorities but that was actually never used throughout the development, implementation, and audit: the diagrams conveyed all information needed and served as a clear basis for its understanding when discussing with the development and auditing teams. Differences in the educational backgrounds of technicians, engineers or physicists played little or no role at all.<br>*** <br><br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here: <br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/ <br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/ <br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/ <br><br>*** <br>Chapters: <br>0:00 - Intro and outline <br>2:17 - What is CERN? <br>5:19 - CERN Radioactive Waste and how to eliminate it <br>13:20 - Current process specifications and limitations <br>18:29 - New approach and result <br>33:42 - Conclusions <br>35:18 - Q&A: Did you use Capella to manage your requirements? <br>36:06 - Q&A: What are the prospects for Capella at CERN?<br>40:21 - Q&A: Are there regulatory requirements to validate the machines/processes?<br>41:34 - Q&A: Did you first copy the 49 specifications into your model?<br>42:46 - Q&A: How and when do you decide the level of detail in the model?<br>44:12 - Q&A: Have you ever tried reverse engineering?<br>45:30 - Q&A: Did you model operational scenarios?<br><br>***",

    "title": "Collaborative Model-Based Engineering and Large Systems Development | ESA | Capella Days 2023",
    "description": "Presented by Catherine Morlet and Alberto González from the European Space Agency.<br>The slides of the presentation are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_ESA_slides<br><br>***<br>This presentation reports on the collaborative Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach followed for Galileo Second Generation using Team4Capella. We address the choices made and methodology applied in Phase B of the system design activity in the past years, with a team spread in different companies’ and geographically distributed. We address the handling of branches of model at different security classification levels with an approach based on synchronising branches rather than split of a large model that makes it suitable for parallel development thus compatible with schedule/time-keeping constraint of the project. Overall, there is a need of rigorous methodology to facilitate synchronisation activities, to have common development approaches including terminology/nomenclature to identify relevant classified items (functions, exchange item, scenarios, etc.), and to document/textualized the information allowing for automatic and frequent generation of the design documentation. <br>In large projects, team members are involved in different roles, thus implying “rules” as well on who is acting on a part of a model. But also, some may be focused on review/supervision of the model which implies the need for means for commenting models rather than developing. Instead of exporting (e.g. in word documents) we expect that tools such as “Publication for Capella” would help enlarging the users of MBSE within the team.<br>Another area under investigation is the collaboration across teams to ensure digital continuity throughout the disciplines or sub-systems. We are starting to use the system-to-subsystem transition plugin with the aim to maintain interfaces between sub-systems and specification of each subsystem, and apportion some engineering parameters between subsystems thanks to a model. Direct interaction at model level is expected, and, through synchronisation mechanisms, integrate at the system level the outcomes from the subsystems in a form of a federated model.<br><br>***<br>References: <br>Embarking to end-to-end system modelling for Galileo Second Generation<br>presented at MBSE2022 in Toulouse<br><br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/<br><br>***<br>Chapters:<br>0:00 - Intro and Outline<br>1:30 - Galileo and its complexity<br>6:09 - Collaborative end-to-end system design including security levels<br>17:03 - Collaboration among stakeholders <br>27:39 - Concluding remarks<br>34:23 - Q&A: Can Capella be used to asses change options for complex system?<br>35:15 - Q&A: Do you use other tools along with Capella to manage requirements?<br>36:40 - Q&A: How did you managed all the interfaces?<br>38:00 - Q&A: Have you worked with external team using SysXML?<br>39:53 - Q&A: Questions concerning the internal and external teams.<br>44:41 - Q&A: Why you choose to use Capella?<br>46:40 - Outro",

It considers the complete problem with its business and technical needs: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training, support, test, manufacturing, and many more. Companies that strive to become Digital Enterprises can leverage Systems Engineering as an approach to consider a company as a System-of-Systems with its individual lifecycles and ecosystems along their Digital Transformation.<br>When applying model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to model required Digital Enterprise capabilities, this approach also supports companies in understanding the impact of topics like e.g. Sustainability. Sustainability impacts a company’s product portfolio, manufacturing systems, service delivery as well as most other business processes. Though, sustainability-oriented approaches like Lifecycle Engineering are necessary, to consider the comprehensive technical, environmental, and economic impacts of decisions within the Enterprise System Lifecycle.<br>This talk will explain – based on a comprehensive example on digital farming solutions – how System Engineering can be applied to understand causalities in Enterprise Systems and to come to meaningful strategic business decisions. It will illustrate how Capella Models can be used for MBSE of agricultural Enterprise Systems with their Products (e.g. grain, meat, milk), Manufacturing Systems (fields, agricultural machinery, stables), Business Processes (e.g. sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, milking) and Ecosystems (e.g. agricultural machinery manufacturers, contract workers, satellite data providers). This talk will also demonstrate, how such Capella Models can consequentially be leveraged to apply the method of Lifecycle Engineering to understand the impact of lifecycle-spanning topics like Sustainability on the Architecture of Enterprises, its Products, Manufacturing systems and Business Processes.<br><br>***<br>References:<br>-C.

    "description": "Enhance the Efficiency of Systems Engineering with a Tailoring of SE Processes and ARCADIA Method.<br><br>Presented by Bruno Vuillemin from Capgemini Engineering.<br>The slides of the presentation are available right here: https://bit.ly/CD23_Capgemini-engineering_slides<br><br>***<br>The latest INCOSE Handbook V5 defines the Tailoring to “adapt the processes to ensure that they meet the needs of an organisation or a project”.<br>The objective of this paper and presentation is to share a tailoring approach defined by CAPGEMINI Engineering for System Engineering processes and ARCADIA method. This approach is generic and is used into several projects for Energy and Railway industries.<br>The objective of this approach is to enhance the efficiency (value driven) of the System Architecting and Engineering activities on a project. <br>The principle of the tailoring approach is to focus from “generic” (coming from SE standards or general-purpose ARCADIA description or general-purpose usage of CAPELLA tool) down to a “specific” (applicable by the project team for the objectives and the context of a real project).<br>This approach is based on a framework (to define generic standards, processes and method). Then, several steps of the approach allow to tailor generic processes and the ARCADIA method. Then, the tailored SE processes and the tailored ARCADIA method are formalized into documents to allow their concrete application on a real project by the project team.<br>The tailoring framework defined by CAPGEMINI is composed of 1) a BPMN model of SE processes, activities and tasks from ISO15288 / INCOSE Handbook, 2) a generic datamodel of SE concepts used by processes, 3) an ARCADIA cartography of levels, objects and views.<br>The steps of the approach allow to define SE/MBSE added values expected by the project. Then a ranking of complexity of the System of Interest will support the tailoring of SE processes and ARCADIA method.<br>To support the concrete application of the project, the output of the tailoring approach is a SEMP document (System Engineering Management Plan) for the project and a MBSE method based on ARCADIA.

One of the emergent challenges in this space is the seamless translation of information from MBSE models into other actionable formats, such as FMECAs (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis). Historically, the FMECA generation process has been reliant on cross-functional engineering teams collaborating in brainstorming sessions to identify potential failure modes before they can even start analysis the effects and criticality of these failure modes. While effective, this approach is time-consuming and can often overlook critical failure modes due to inherent limitations of manual brainstorming.  <br><br>Using a case study from the semiconductor equipment industry, our presentation describes a method of leveraging Capella MBSE models to streamline the generation of FMECAs. Utilizing Python4Capella, we automated the extraction of vital MBSE model objects and relationships, essential for generating an exhaustive FMECA, and seamlessly populated it into an MS Excel based FMECA template that is commonly used by the engineering community.<br> <br>This presentation will offer participants: <br>-The significance and role of MBSE models in building a robust FMECA. <br>-An overview of our Python4Capella based solution, shedding light on how we captured and translated the Capella objects to a FMECA Excel template.<br>-Demonstrable advantages, insights, and takeaways from our semiconductor equipment industry case study, underscoring the transformative power of MBSE and automation in accuracy, efficiency, and traceability.<br> <br>Equipped with a practical exploration of our methodology, attendees will be equipped with a potent strategy, not only to reimagine FMECA generation in their domains but also to maximize the potential of their MBSE models, making design reliability and safety assessments more rigorous and efficient.<br><br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/<br><br>***<br>Chapters:<br>0:00 - Intro and agenda<br>1:26 - Presentation of the company<br>2:50 - Product Development & MBSE<br>5:35 - Electrostatic chucks<br>7:30 - MBSE driven design for e-chucks<br>18:25 - FMECA : Failures Modes, Effects, Criticality analysis<br>20:55 - Typical Design FMECA Process<br>23:55 - Shortcomings of Current Process<br>27:34 - Leveraging MBSE Models for FMECAs<br>32:53 - Building FMECA matrix from MBSE model<br>35:22 - Advantages and next steps<br>39:47 - Q&A: Will you share the Python scripts developed for export to FMECA?<br>40:05 - Q&A: Any internal figures regarding productivity/quality improvements?<br>41:47 - Q&A: How to ensure the physical components in Capella are up to date with the ones on your CAD system?<br>43:40 - Q&A: Evaluating the effects on your system of every failure of the FMECA?<br>44:58 - Outro",

This presentation focuses on applying some of these Lean Startup techniques within Capella to effectively arrive at system architectures.<br><br>In contrast to other MBSE programs, Capella embeds a design methodology that drives its usage; it provides a framework for defining the problem before progressing to solutions. This presentation will guide the strategic application of Lean Startup techniques within the different architectural levels prescribed by ARCADIA. To ensure problem-solution fit for each stakeholder, unique Value Proposition Canvases (VPCs) connect their needs and wants with how the system will work for them. In the Operational Analysis phase, problem interviews will help determine the Customer Profile portion of the VPCs. Functions in the System Analysis represent the gain achievers and pain relievers proposed in the VPCs Value Map section. These are then validated with solution interviews before starting the logical or physical architecture. During both stages of the architectural design, functional chains are used to determine which parts of the design need to be validated. Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), based on these functional chains, can be built to collect validated learnings about customers and other stakeholders. MVPs are not saleable products themselves, but the learnings from these MVPs are integrated in the architecture to ensure that the final product creates value.<br><br>***<br>References:<br>TheLeanStartup.com<br><br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Capella Forum: https://forum.mbse-capella.org/<br><br>***<br>Chapters:<br>0:00 - Traditional approach<br>5:22 - Lean Startup Approach<br>9:45 - Understanding the Needs with Capella<br>13:00 - Understanding the Needs: Operational Analysis<br>22:16 - Understanding the Needs: System Analysis<br>30:45 - The Architecture<br>37:14 - Conclusion<br>38:32 - Q&A: How to handle expectations if you only earn gains and pains?<br>39:15 - Q&A: How would you rate the role of the costs?<br>40:48 - Q&A: Are your customers always willing to share their pains?<br>42:10 - Q&A: How do you tune the detail level of your Capella model for FEMECA?<br>43:18 - Outro",

This presentation proposes an approach to improve the development of advanced electron microscopes by using Capella as an authoritative source of information. To support design decisions, a Capella AddOn has been developed to obtain quantitative information, such as throughput numbers, for a particular workflow. First, we will illustrate how functional and system decompositions can be captured and serve as company-wide architecting assets to inform design decisions. Next, we will outline how simulating Capella models can bring valuable insights to modelers. During a demo, we’ll simulate Capella’s Functional chains using the open-source simulation tool POOSL (https://github.com/eclipse/poosl) , and visualize results using the freely available TRACE4CPS tool (https://www.eclipse.org/trace4cps/). Re-using functions from the reference architecture allows us to reason about design aspects such as the relation between throughput and design choices about function allocation and parallelism.<br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Twitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

    "description": "Interplanetary Space Mission as a reverse-engineering background for the Capella environment. <br><br>***<br>Presented by: Emanuele Tomassi, Davide Bellicoso & Riccardo Rambaldi from Politecnico di Milano during Capella Days 2022<br>Slides: https://bit.ly/capelladays2022_Politecnico-di-Milano_slides<br>***<br>Systems engineering is an iterative approach traditionally applied one-way, from the definition of the user needs to the implementation of a solution that satisfies certain requirements and is constrained by cost and schedule. This presentation instead aims at exploring the educational benefits of applying the opposite practice, thus retrieving system and subsystem level requirements based on a solution already implemented and taking advantage of the MBSE possibilities to realize a model of the system according to the ARCADIA method and systems engineering approach, using the Capella MBSE Tool. This reverse-engineering process has been applied to a renowned Space mission, the ESA Mars Express satellite, whose goal is to investigate all aspects of the martian environment, including the subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet, in order to search for evidence of extinct or extant life. The uppermost goal of this project is to demonstrate the benefits for university students at a Master's level keen on systems engineering in implementing the Capella tool to retrieve the system architecture and the operational processes in a \"reversed\" strategy. In this work, students have been compelled to apply systems engineering processes to justify the design choices and exploit the already well-known missions and capabilities to build the architecture and functional chains as a starting point for the reverse engineering of the identified subsystems. The results prove it is possible, and also recommendable time-wise, to teach Space engineering and Systems engineering students by using this inverse approach, rather than the canonic one in which students have to design a whole mission from scratch.<br>***<br>Stay up to date on Capella news and events by following our socials here:<br><br>Website: https://www.eclipse.org/capella/<br>LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/capella-mbse-tool/<br>Twitter : https://twitter.com/capella_arcadia",

UKAEA, the organisation running the STEP project, is applying Model-Based Systems Engineering using the Capella tool.<br><br>The focus of our approach in managing the complexity of the system is to perform system analysis and logical architecture analysis, to generate engineering artefacts from the model. Through NGO (Needs, Goals, Objectives) analysis key system capabilities were realised to functional chains, which forms the basis for further refinement of the Logical Architecture. The differentiation between logical and physical architectures has ensured that the design stays at the logical space and the team focuses on defining the problem space. This approach has improved interface management process, by creating model-based interface documents, using the model as ‘single source of truth’ to achieve consistency. The architecture definition activities allowed early formalisation of the textual requirements, to drive detailed engineering design in the next phase.<br><br>Adopting Capella comes with challenges - one of which stems from the unique characteristic of the concept phase – the need to generate architectural variants and evaluating them. The framework and the language are limited in performing variant modelling, a topic UKAEA plans to investigate further. Another challenge was that middle-out approach was favoured for STEP whereas Arcadia method prefers the top-down approach.<br><br>Throughout this journey, adopting Capella with its use-friendly interfaces has allowed us to better engage with the programme in the MBSE approach and indoctrinate better SE practices.<br><br>Creative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

At the very least, systems engineering organizes and integrates the work of the various engineering disciplines and groups. Slightly more ambitiously, MBSE can translate system requirements into system elements. Ideally though, the system model, as the output of the MBSE process, should directly participate in the digital thread, as the link between the system requirements and the bill-of-material.<br><br>This presentation will show how the more idealised role (as a participant in the digital thread) can now be realized and explore some of the benefits and costs associated to such an approach.",

CMATS replaces the current civilian Air Traffic Management (ATM) system and Defence ATM system, delivering the most advanced and integrated ATM system in the world. It will manage more than 11% of the earth’s airspace and will deliver Air Traffic Services to some of the world’s busiest air routes.<br><br>Scope: Over the last 4 years of the Design phases of the program, the System-of-Systems Architecture team has defined and deployed a new way of working by focussing on capturing the system-of-systems architecture using state-of-the-art modelling techniques.<br>A plan was put in place where the team collectively defined a target set of modelling goals in order to grow the team’s competency.

The talk proposes a critical analysis of a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach using ARCADIA and the Capella tool, applied to real CubeSat mission, with the aim of showing potentials and lacks.<br><br>Firstly, the way requirements are managed and traced using the Requirements Viewpoint is presented, highlighting the necessity of having a dedicated diagram for the trees generation; a solution to that is proposed in order to easily trace backwards requirements whenever needed. Following the ARCADIA method, the approach begins with the high-level objectives definition through the Operational Analysis, moving to a first internal functional analysis exploiting the second level of Capella, the System Analysis. The Logical Architecture is then developed introducing the concept of subsystem, leading to big decisions which will drive the successive Physical Architecture. The latter opens the road to all CubeSat components modeling using the concept of Node Physical Component, together with physical interfaces definition. Great use of all Capella concepts is done, such as Functional Chains, Control Functions, Replicas, Basic Mass and Price Viewpoints etc.<br><br>As the approach has been applied to a real space project, Phases and Modes have also been modeled exploiting respectively Scenario Diagrams, also used to define mission Concept of Operations, and State Machine Diagrams. Some thoughts oriented toward an improvement of the Modes management will be discussed. Lastly, ARCADIA and Capella do not provide a proper way of dealing with Assembly, Integration, Verification and Testing activities within the same architectural model, therefore an innovative approach is proposed and discussed to include such aspects in the model.",

In Germany, DB AG works within the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland. Next to the implementation of ETCS/DSTW technology in the first stage, the initiatives aims in the second stage to improve the performance, quality and efficiency of the railway system by higher degrees of automation in traffic management, train driving and infrastructure operation. This requires implementation of new technologies like artificial intelligence, localization and perception sensors, cloud computing and 5G connectivity.<br><br>The challenge is pretty serious - to modernize and digitalize something as complex we need a solid understanding of the railway system itself, the surrounding actors, the operational processes / workflows, functions and responsibilities. And then we need a way to design automation concepts and test those against the operational needs - we call it The Reference Architecture. An analysis of that scale requires knowledge and expertise across multiple domains and involves a pretty large number of stakeholders. We found ARCADIA method to be just the right thing and as Capella is freely available we could easily test how it fits.<br><br>The reference architecture is being developed in according to a detailed process that elaborates on the basic steps of ARCADIA to give specific guidelines on every step of engineering. The process is broadly structured in the layers of ARCADIA, then influenced by the safety and RAM standard EN 50126, the systems engineering standard ISO 15288 and the specific situation we found ourselves in. The process is described according to architecture framework standard ISO 42010 with an emphasis on precise definition of the contents of each modelling artefact. Early results of the deployment of this detailed process have been positive, with reductions in the complexity of the model, and clearer, more precise and more consistent functions being identified against a reusable pattern.<br><br>To validate the design decisions and assumptions that we made in the Reference Architecture, when a simulation is insufficient, we do prototype projects. The Sensors4Rail prototype project was designed in Capella nearly from the start. And for a number of common engineering reasons it was designed bottom up. It is an example of a classical project madness with disruptive changes, priority shifts and very high level of uncertainty. And thanks to flexibility of Capella and ARCADIA we got through it with the model being the place where most of the engineering decisions took place - be it functional, software or hardware engineering.<br><br>As the adoption went on we saw a need for deriving documents and engineering artifacts from the model and sharing those with various internal and external stakeholders. We tried to do that by hand first but as it was time consuming we went through a project to automate workflows around Capella. Today we operate a number of CI/CD pipelines that deliver documents, engineering artifact and Confluence page updates on every commit. We have a framework that enables us to derive engineering artifacts from the model quickly, traverse it in all possible directions and render in any shape and form (IDL, pdf, xlsx). For those projects that use TeamForCapella we operate a self-service web-based management environment.<br><br>In this presentation you’ll have a guided tour through the MBSE Toolchain we made around Capella, Gitlab, Confluence, Jira and TeamForCapella and get a feeling for what automation one could get by mixing open-source with nice (open API) commercial and simple bespoke tools.<br><br>Creative commons BY-ND Licence: Attributon + NoDerivatives",

The case study was a University CubeSat team, where team members join the project as a part of their thesis, while the project continues for 2-3 years, and modeling the code logic can reduce some of the onboarding effort required when new members want to reuse or improve on existing codebase.",

The system shall be able to trigger alerts of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) in real-time with a maximum of associated data. It is composed of a space segment (a set of various sensors embedded on a satellite) associated with a worldwide antenna ground network, all managed by the two agencies.<br><br>The design of this system was conducted within the framework of the CNES engineering process, based on a set of documents cascading the textual requirements from the high-level concept of operations to the technical specification of equipment. The validation of the obtained specification mainly relies on human expertise and on the validation campaign. The complexity of the system made it a perfect candidate for experimentation of MBSE using Capella. Two projects took place successively in this context: a first one was an R&T study, dedicated to the analysis of the current process and the evaluation of the potential benefits that MBSE could bring (restricted to some part of the system but spread on several engineering layers (architecture, simulation, satellite database definition...)). Due to promising results, a second project, based on the models realized during the first study, was dedicated to the operational capture of the system validation.<br><br>The smooth incursion of Capella in CNES engineering process was undeniably well received. The SVOM experts were converted to this new way of working. The building of an operational model-based toolchain to capture the system architecture and its associated V&V specification is an achievement that opens the door to a wider reach of MBSE within CNES.<br><br>Sessions slides: https://bit.ly/capelladays2020_artal_slides<br><br>All the Capella Days slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020<br><br>Creative commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

    "description": "MBSE and the High-Tech Equipment Industry, how do they match up?<br><br>By Teun Hendriks (ESI-TNO)<br><br>MBSE is by now widely adopted in the Aerospace and Defense industry. These industries however typically develop their systems with very large, one-of-a-kind system projects, following the V model. A large upfront (MB)SE effort is justified then as the cost of late failures are extremely high.<br><br>The High-Tech Equipment Industry on the other hand develops its systems incrementally with an agile Systems Engineering process, supporting many product variants and often a configure-to-order sales process.<br><br>How does MBSE match up with the characteristics of the High-Tech Equipment Industry? ESI and its partners have started a collaborative project to study together whether, and if so how, MBSE, or MBSE elements, can improve Systems Engineering in this industry business context.<br><br>This talk will provide an update on the state of SE in the High-Tech Equipment Industry, its use of models, and the outlook on the fit of MBSE in this industry context.<br><br>Session slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/capella-days-2020-mbse-and-the-hightech-equipment-industry-how-do-they-match-up<br><br>All slides from Capella Days 2020: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020<br><br>Creative Commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

    "description": "Integrating MBSE and Life Cycle Assessment for Removing Plastics from the Oceans with The SeaCleaners<br><br>By Arnaud Dieumegard & Raphaël Pagé (Obeo)<br><br>More than 8 million tons of plastic are dumped in the oceans every year. If we don’t take action, in 2050, there will be more plastic than fishes in the oceans!<br><br>The SeaCleaners association has been founded to provide global, long-term, and worldwide solutions for fighting against ocean plastic pollution. The flagship project initiated by The SeaCleaners is the MANTA, the first seagoing vessel capable of collecting and processing in continuous flow large quantities of macro plastic waste floating at the surface of oceans. Its design has been focusing on many innovative technologies in the field of renewable energy production or by limiting her global carbon footprint maximizing energy self-sufficiency.<br><br>In this talk, we will present a Capella extension developed by Obeo in partnership with The SeaCleaners and Altran to facilitate the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) of complex systems. This extension consists of additional concepts added to Capella for inventorying components' physical characteristics and the substances they consume and/or emit. This information attached to the system architecture can be automatically exported as an initial inventory analysis to LCA tools used by environmental experts to perform their impact analysis (such as SimaPro and OpenLCA).<br><br>Experimented on a MANTA subsystem, we will show how this integration between Capella and LCA Tools accelerates the evaluation of the impacts a system has on its environment and helps system designers to make architecture decisions that are better for the planet.<br><br>Session slides: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/capella-days-2020-integrating-mbse-and-life-cycle-assessment-for-removing-plastics-from-the-oceans-with-the-seacleaners<br><br>All the slides from Capella Days 2020: https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/clipboards/capella-days-2020<br><br>Creative Commons BY-ND Licence: Attribution + NoDerivatives",

Sept ans après, la solution Capella est désormais confortablement installée sur le marché des solutions d’architecture de systèmes industriels, avec plusieurs centaines d’organisations utilisatrices sur tous les continents. Issu d’une collaboration entamée plusieurs années auparavant entre le grand groupe international d’ingénierie et une jeune startup nantaise, Capella est un atelier d’ingénierie système (MBSE) permettant de définir l’architecture de systèmes complexes dans des domaines tels que le spatial, les transports, la santé ou les télécoms. Avec ce talk, nous reviendrons sur la genèse du projet et la stratégie mise en œuvre pour sa mise en open-source. En particulier, comment Thales et Obeo collaborent étroitement pour faire évoluer Capella, assurer sa promotion au niveau international et développer un écosystème riche et diversifié à même d’accompagner les démarches de découverte, d’adoption et de déploiement.<br><br>Etienne JULIOT - Vice-Président - Obeo<br>Juan NAVAS - Modelling & Simulation Lead Expert - Thales",

    "description": "Realization of Model-Based Safety Analysis and Integration with Capella<br>by MARK ZELLER, Siemens CT<br><br>The importance of mission or safety-critical software systems in many application domains of embedded systems is continuously growing, and so is the effort and complexity for reliability and safety analysis. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) is currently one of the key approaches to cope with increasing system complexity.<br><br>With Component Fault Trees (CFTs) there is a model- and component-based methodology for safety analysis, which extends the advantages of model-based development to safety & reliability engineering. In this talk, we demonstrate how to ease the development of safety-critical systems by implementing a graphical modeling tool for Component Fault Trees using Sirius and integrate safety analysis capabilities in a model-based system engineering workflow in Capella.<br><br>Mark Zeller, Siemens CT<br>Marc Zeller works as a Senior Key Expert for model-based safety and reliability engineering at Siemens Corporate Technology. His research interests are focused on the efficient and effective development of dependability-relevant Cyber-physical Systems using model-based engineering techniques.
